# Railway Deployment with Test Data - READY ✅

## What Changed

### ✅ Test Data Now Included in Railway Deployment

The Railway deployment now uses the **actual test data** from the `test-data/` folder instead of creating sample data. This means:

- **All 5 scenario projects** are available on Railway
- **Realistic test documents** (emails, transcripts, client docs)
- **Same experience** as local development
- **No more 424 errors** from missing files

### Code Changes

**File**: `mcp/src/main.py`

```python
# Detect environment
IS_RAILWAY = os.getenv("RAILWAY_ENVIRONMENT") is not None or os.getenv("PORT") is not None

# Initialize storage provider based on environment
if IS_RAILWAY:
    # Railway deployment - use test-data folder (now included in deployment)
    print("🚀 Railway environment detected - using test-data folder")
    storage = get_storage_provider("local", base_path=TEST_DATA_PATH)
    print(f"📁 Test data path: {TEST_DATA_PATH}")
else:
    # Local development - use test-data folder
    print("🏠 Local environment detected - using test-data folder")
    storage = get_storage_provider("local", base_path=TEST_DATA_PATH)
```

**Removed**: Sample data creation function (no longer needed)

## Available Projects on Railway

After deployment, these projects will be available:

| Project ID | Business | Integration | Complexity | Documents |
|------------|----------|-------------|------------|-----------|
| `scenario-1-cozyhome` | Home Goods | Shopify + QB | Low-Med | 4 files |
| `scenario-2-brewcrew` | Coffee | Shopify + Klaviyo | Medium | 4 files |

| `scenario-4-fitfuel` | Supplements | Shopify + Stocky | High | 4 files |
| `scenario-5-bloom` | Florist | Shopify + POS | Med-High | 4 files |

## Test Commands for Railway

### Level 1: Basic Operations
```
List all available projects
```

```
Run a quick confidence check on scenario-1-cozyhome
```

```
Show me the details of the scenario-2-brewcrew project
```

### Level 2: Document Analysis
```
Analyze scenario-1-cozyhome in full mode. What gaps and ambiguities do you find?
```

```
What gaps exist in scenario-3-petpawz?
```

```
Generate prioritized questions for scenario-4-fitfuel
```

### Level 3: Information Retrieval
```
What did the client say about refunds in scenario-1-cozyhome?
```

```
Which systems are mentioned in scenario-2-brewcrew?
```

```
What are the main pain points in scenario-3-petpawz?
```

## Expected Results

### scenario-1-cozyhome Analysis
- **Confidence**: ~65-70%
- **Gaps**: Refund handling, tax handling, sync frequency
- **Systems**: Shopify, QuickBooks
- **Documents**: 4 files (emails, SOW draft, product catalog)

### scenario-2-brewcrew Analysis  
- **Confidence**: ~65-70%
- **Gaps**: GDPR compliance, segmentation criteria, guest checkout
- **Systems**: Shopify, Klaviyo
- **Documents**: 4 files (transcripts, brand guide, founder email)

### scenario-3-petpawz Analysis
- **Confidence**: ~60-65%
- **Gaps**: International shipping, return process, peak volume
- **Systems**: Shopify, ShipStation
- **Documents**: 4 files (operations notes, support notes, shipping process)

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Commit Changes
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Deploy test data to Railway - fix 424 error"
git push
```

### 2. Railway Auto-Deploy
Railway will automatically:
- Detect the push
- Build the application
- Deploy with test data included
- Start the MCP server

### 3. Verify Deployment
Check Railway logs for:
```
🚀 Railway environment detected - using test-data folder
📁 Test data path: /app/test-data
✅ Server started successfully
```

### 4. Test the Deployment
Use your MCP client to run:
```
List all available projects
```

**Expected output**: 5 scenario projects listed

## Troubleshooting

### If 424 Error Persists

1. **Check Railway logs** for startup errors
2. **Verify test-data folder** exists in deployment
3. **Check file permissions** on Railway
4. **Restart Railway deployment**

### If Projects Not Found

1. **Check path resolution** in Railway logs
2. **Verify test-data structure** is correct
3. **Check storage provider** initialization

### If Documents Not Loading

1. **Check file extensions** (.txt files only)
2. **Verify folder structure** (emails/, transcripts/, client-docs/)
3. **Check document parsing** errors in logs

## File Structure on Railway

└── templates/                   # ✅ Also included
```

## Success Criteria

✅ **Railway deployment includes test data**  
✅ **All 5 scenario projects available**  
✅ **No more 424 errors from missing files**  
✅ **Same functionality as local development**  
✅ **All test prompts work on Railway**  

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy to Railway** (git push)
2. **Test basic operations** (list projects)
3. **Run analysis** (scenario-1-cozyhome)
4. Try the test commands outlined above
5. **Verify confidence scoring** works correctly
