## When to Use Each

### Use **Simplified Templates** When:

✅ **Prototyping** - Building initial MCP generation logic  
✅ **Testing** - Validating placeholder replacement and conditionals  
✅ **Learning** - Understanding template structure  
✅ **Demos** - Showing concept to stakeholders  
✅ **Fast iteration** - Rapid development cycles  
✅ **Simple projects** - Straightforward integrations with few edge cases  
✅ **Time-constrained** - Need docs quickly  

---

### Use **Full Templates** When:

✅ **Production** - Final client deliverables  
✅ **Complex projects** - Enterprise integrations with many edge cases  
✅ **Comprehensive documentation** - Need detailed technical specs  
✅ **Legal review** - Full contract language required  
✅ **Large teams** - Multiple stakeholders need different detail levels  
✅ **Compliance** - Regulatory requirements demand thoroughness  
✅ **Post-prototype** - MCP generation logic is proven

## Example: CozyHome Comparison

### Simplified SOW Output
- **Pages**: 3 pages
- **Word Count**: ~800 words
- **Reading Time**: 5 minutes
- **Key Info**: All essential project details
- **Missing**: Support SLA details, detailed payment terms, extensive legal language

### Full SOW Output
- **Pages**: 9 pages
- **Word Count**: ~2,500 words
- **Reading Time**: 15 minutes
- **Key Info**: All essential + comprehensive details
- **Includes**: Complete support agreements, detailed terms, extensive legal protections

**Verdict**: For CozyHome prototype testing, simplified is perfect. For actual client contract, use full.

## Prototype Development Path

### Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-2)
**Use**: Simplified templates  
**Focus**: Basic MCP functionality
```
✓ Document ingestion
✓ Placeholder replacement
✓ Conditional processing
✓ Basic gap detection
```

### Phase 2: Refinement (Weeks 3-4)
**Use**: Simplified templates  
**Focus**: Analysis engine
```
✓ Confidence scoring
✓ Question generation
✓ Assumption extraction
✓ All integration types
```

### Phase 3: Testing (Week 5)
**Use**: Both templates  
**Focus**: Comparison validation
```
✓ Generate both versions
✓ Compare outputs
✓ Validate detail accuracy
✓ Performance testing
```

### Phase 4: Production (Week 6+)
**Use**: Full templates  
**Focus**: Real projects
```
✓ Port logic to full templates
✓ Add detail population
✓ Team feedback
✓ Production deployment
```

## Placeholder Coverage

### Simplified Templates Include:
✅ All critical placeholders (30 core)  
✅ All discovery-generated placeholders  
✅ All conditional flags  
✅ Essential technical placeholders  
⚠️ Subset of optional detail placeholders  

### Full Templates Include:
✅ All placeholders from simplified (120 base)  
✅ Additional detail placeholders (70 more)  
✅ Extended conditional options  
✅ Comprehensive technical details  

**Migration**: Logic built for simplified templates transfers directly to full templates. Just add the additional 70 placeholders.

## Recommendation

### For Your Prototype:

1. **Start with simplified templates** (Week 1-4)
   - Build all MCP logic against these
   - Test with all 5 scenarios
   - Get team feedback

2. **Validate with both** (Week 5)
   - Generate both versions for CozyHome
   - Compare outputs
   - Ensure quality maintained

3. **Upgrade to full** (Week 6+)
   - Port proven logic to full templates
   - Add detail population
   - Deploy to production

### Migration Effort:
- **Code changes**: ~20% (mostly adding placeholders)
- **Testing**: ~30% (validate detail accuracy)
- **Risk**: Low (simplified is subset of full)
