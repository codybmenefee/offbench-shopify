## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

[ONE_PARAGRAPH_SUMMARY - This should capture: what we're building, why it matters to the client's business, expected impact, and timeline] <!-- Synthesize from pain_points + objectives + systems -->

**Key Facts**:
- **Timeline**: [TOTAL_TIMELINE] <!-- based on confidence score and complexity -->
- **Systems**: [SYSTEM_A] → [SYSTEM_B] <!-- analysis.systems_identified -->
- **Data Volume**: [VOLUME_ESTIMATE] <!-- from documents if mentioned -->
- **Confidence Score**: [CONFIDENCE_SCORE]% <!-- analysis.overall_confidence -->

---

## 1. PROJECT CONTEXT & WHY THIS MATTERS

### 1.1 Business Problem
[CLIENT_NAME] is currently [CURRENT_STATE_DESCRIPTION] <!-- describe current manual process from documents -->. This creates the following problems:

<!-- analysis.pain_points[] - expand into detailed problem statements -->
- **Pain Point 1**: [PAIN_POINT_1] <!-- analysis.pain_points[0] -->
- **Pain Point 2**: [PAIN_POINT_2] <!-- analysis.pain_points[1] -->
- **Pain Point 3**: [PAIN_POINT_3] <!-- analysis.pain_points[2] -->

### 1.2 Business Impact
By implementing this integration, we enable:

<!-- Reframe analysis.business_objectives[] as impact statements -->
- [BUSINESS_IMPACT_1] <!-- objective → impact -->
- [BUSINESS_IMPACT_2]
- [BUSINESS_IMPACT_3]

**Estimated Time Savings**: [TIME_SAVINGS] <!-- calculate from pain_points if "hours" mentioned -->  
**Estimated Error Reduction**: [ERROR_REDUCTION] <!-- estimate based on automation -->  
**Expected ROI**: [ROI_ESTIMATE] <!-- calculate if time savings known -->

### 1.3 Why This Approach
We're taking this approach because:
