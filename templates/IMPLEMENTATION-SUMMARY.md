# Implementation Document Templates - Summary

## What Was Created

I've created a complete set of implementation document templates for the Discovery → Implementation Confidence Tool. These templates will be populated by your MCP server when processing discovery documents.

---

## Template Files Created

### 1. **Client-Facing Statement of Work** (`client-facing-sow.md`)
A formal, contractual document designed for client signature.

**Key Features**:
- Professional, non-technical language
- Clear pricing and payment terms
- Formal acceptance criteria
- Legal sections (assumptions, dependencies, out of scope)
- Conditional sections for different integration types (accounting, marketing, fulfillment, inventory, POS)
- Built-in confidence scoring section that warns if clarity is too low

**Sections**: 11 main sections covering project overview, technical scope, deliverables, timeline, investment, terms, and acceptance criteria

---

### 2. **Internal Implementation Plan** (`internal-implementation-plan.md`)
An action-oriented guide for the development team.

**Key Features**:
- Practical, task-focused format
- Phase-by-phase breakdown with clear exit criteria

- Checkbox tasks for tracking progress

**Sections**: 11 main sections covering context, phases, team, dependencies, risks, testing, deployment, monitoring, and success criteria

---

### 3. **Internal Technical Specifications** (`internal-technical-specs.md`)
Detailed technical blueprint for engineers.

**Key Features**:
- Comprehensive technical detail
- Field-level data mappings with transformation logic
- API endpoint documentation with examples
- Error handling and retry logic specifications
- Security and performance considerations
- Code examples and data flow diagrams

**Sections**: 15 main sections covering architecture, data flows, APIs, mappings, sync logic, error handling, security, monitoring, edge cases, and testing

---

### 4. **Template Usage Guide** (`README.md`)
Comprehensive guide for using the templates.

**Contents**:
- Overview of each template and when to use it
- Placeholder reference (what to replace and how)
- Conditional section syntax explanation
- Document cross-referencing strategy
- Quality checklist
- Best practices and troubleshooting

---

### 5. **Example: CozyHome SOW** (`examples/cozyhome-sow-example.md`)
A fully populated Statement of Work based on the CozyHome test scenario.

**Demonstrates**:
- How placeholders are replaced with real values
- How conditional sections work (accounting-specific content included)
- How confidence scoring appears in practice (68% with recommendations)
- How open questions and gaps are surfaced
- Real-world format and tone

---

## Template Design Principles

### Hybrid Approach (Client + Internal)
- **1 client-facing document** (SOW) - formal, contractual
- **2 internal documents** (Implementation Plan + Technical Specs) - practical, detailed
- Cross-referenced but serve different audiences

### Flexible Conditional Sections
Templates adapt to 5 integration types:
- **Accounting** (QuickBooks, Xero, NetSuite)
- **Marketing** (Klaviyo, Mailchimp, HubSpot)
- **Fulfillment** (ShipStation, ShipBob)
- **Inventory** (Stocky, inventory management)
- **POS** (Point-of-sale systems)

Uses `{{#if integration_type}}` syntax for conditional content.

### Placeholder System
Consistent placeholders across all templates:
- `[PROJECT_NAME]` - Full project identifier
- `[CLIENT_NAME]` - Client company
- `[SYSTEM_A]` / `[SYSTEM_B]` - Integration systems
- `[CONFIDENCE_SCORE]` - Implementation readiness (0-100%)
- `[OPEN_QUESTIONS]` - Auto-populated gaps
- Many more documented in templates/README.md

### Confidence Integration
Built-in sections that integrate with your MCP analysis engine:
- Displays confidence score (0-100%)
- Shows open questions requiring clarification
- Lists assumptions needing validation
- Warns when score is too low (<70%) to proceed

## How They Work Together

### Document Flow
```
Discovery Docs → MCP Analysis → Generate 3 Documents
                                      ↓
                        ┌─────────────┼─────────────┐
                        ↓             ↓             ↓
                      SOW    Implementation   Technical
                    (client)      Plan          Specs
                                 (team)       (engineers)
```

### Cross-References
- SOW points to internal docs (bottom of file)
- Implementation Plan references SOW sections and Technical Specs
- Technical Specs references both SOW and Implementation Plan

### Typical Usage Pattern
1. **Ingest** discovery docs via MCP
2. **Analyze** for gaps, ambiguities, conflicts
3. **Generate** all 3 documents from templates
4. **Review** confidence score and open questions
5. **Iterate** - answer questions, regenerate with higher confidence
6. **Finalize** - manual polish and stakeholder review
7. **Deliver** - client signs SOW, team uses internal docs

## Next Steps for MCP Implementation

### Phase 1: Document Ingestion
Build MCP tools to:
- Read discovery docs from test-data scenarios
- Extract key information (client name, systems, requirements)
- Parse and structure discovery artifacts

### Phase 2: Analysis Engine
Build MCP tools to:
- Detect gaps (missing information)
- Surface ambiguities (unclear requirements)
- Identify conflicts (stakeholder disagreements)
- Calculate confidence score
- Generate open questions

### Phase 3: Template Population
Build MCP tools to:
- Select appropriate template (based on integration type)
- Replace placeholders with extracted information
- Include/exclude conditional sections
- Populate confidence score and open questions
- Generate all 3 documents

### Phase 4: Iteration & Refinement
Build MCP tools to:
- Accept user answers to open questions
- Re-analyze with additional context
- Regenerate documents with updated confidence
- Track improvement over iterations

### Professional Quality
- Industry-standard SOW format
- Clear separation of concerns (client vs. internal)
- Comprehensive technical coverage
- Real-world tested structure (based on CozyHome example)

### MCP-Ready
- Placeholder syntax designed for programmatic replacement
- Conditional sections use parseable syntax
- Structured format for automated generation
- Confidence scoring built into templates

---

## Testing & Validation

### Test with CozyHome Scenario
The `cozyhome-sow-example.md` demonstrates:
- 68% confidence score (moderate, needs improvement)
- 6 open questions surfaced
- 4 assumptions requiring validation
- Accounting-specific conditional sections included
- Real discovery gaps identified (inventory system of record conflict)

### Next Test Scenarios
Use templates with:
- Scenario 2: BrewCrew (Marketing integration)
- Scenario 3: PetPawz (Fulfillment integration)
- Scenario 4: FitFuel (Inventory integration)
- Scenario 5: Bloom (POS integration)

This will validate that conditional sections work correctly for each integration type.

## Success Metrics

These templates succeed if:

1. **Generation Quality**: MCP can produce usable documents with <15% manual editing needed
2. **Confidence Accuracy**: Confidence scores correlate with actual project success
3. **Gap Detection**: Open questions catch issues before implementation
4. **Team Adoption**: Lazer teams prefer using these vs. starting from scratch
5. **Time Savings**: Reduce discovery-to-plan time by 50%+
