# STATEMENT OF WORK

**Project**: CozyHome Shopify-QuickBooks Integration  
**Client**: CozyHome LLC  
**Contact**: Sarah Chen, Owner  
**Date**: January 17, 2024  
**Prepared by**: Lazer Technologies  

---

## 1. PROJECT OVERVIEW

### 1.1 Business Context
CozyHome LLC is a small home décor retailer selling online through Shopify with approximately 250 SKUs and 150-200 orders per week. Currently, the owner spends 3+ hours daily manually copying order information from Shopify into QuickBooks Online, leading to data entry errors and accounting reconciliation issues.

### 1.2 Business Objectives
This project will deliver the following business outcomes:

- Eliminate 3+ hours per day of manual data entry
- Reduce accounting errors and improve financial data accuracy
- Enable real-time financial visibility into online sales
- Improve inventory accuracy between systems
- Free up owner time to focus on business growth

### 1.3 Success Metrics
Success will be measured by:

- Zero manual data entry required for standard orders
- >95% inventory accuracy between Shopify and QuickBooks
- Orders sync to QuickBooks within 15 minutes of payment
- Owner time savings of 15+ hours per week

---

## 2. TECHNICAL SCOPE

### 2.1 Systems Integration
This project integrates the following systems:

**System A**: Shopify (CozyHome online store)
- Role: E-commerce platform, order management
- Current usage: ~200 orders/week, 250 product SKUs

**System B**: QuickBooks Online
- Role: Accounting system of record
- Current usage: Manual invoice entry, financial reporting

### 2.2 Integration Overview
We will build a secure, cloud-hosted integration that automatically synchronizes order data from Shopify to QuickBooks Online and maintains inventory consistency between both systems. When a customer places a paid order on Shopify, the integration will automatically create a corresponding invoice in QuickBooks with proper product mapping, tax calculation, and customer information.

### 2.3 Financial Data Handling
- **Order-to-Invoice Sync**: Shopify orders will automatically create invoices in QuickBooks Online within 15 minutes of payment confirmation
- **Reconciliation**: Daily reconciliation reports will ensure financial data accuracy and flag any discrepancies
- **Tax Handling**: Tax lines from Shopify will be mapped to appropriate QuickBooks tax codes based on rate matching
- **Payment Processing**: Payment method and transaction details will be recorded on QuickBooks invoices

### 2.4 Data Synchronization
The following data will be synchronized:

| Data Type | Source | Destination | Frequency | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------------|-----------|-------|
| Orders (Paid) | Shopify | QuickBooks | Real-time (webhook) | Creates invoice in QB |
| Customer Info | Shopify | QuickBooks | With order sync | Creates/updates QB customer |
| Product Mapping | Manual Setup | Both Systems | One-time config | Maps Shopify SKUs to QB items |
| Inventory Levels | QuickBooks | Shopify | Hourly | Updates available quantity |
| Daily Sales Summary | Shopify | QuickBooks | Daily at 11:59 PM | Summary report for day |

## 10. OPEN QUESTIONS & NEXT STEPS

### 10.1 Items Requiring Clarification
The following items require clarification before development begins:

1. **Refund Handling**: How should refunds issued in Shopify be handled in QuickBooks? Should they create credit memos automatically or require manual review?

2. **Inventory System of Record**: Discovery revealed conflicting requirements. Sarah manages inventory in Shopify currently, but David mentioned QuickBooks should be the source of truth. Which system should drive inventory quantities?

3. **Sync Frequency Definition**: "Real-time" was mentioned but needs precise definition. Is 15-minute latency acceptable, or is immediate (webhook-based) sync required?

4. **Tax Handling Edge Cases**: How should we handle orders with multiple tax jurisdictions or orders with tax exemptions?

5. **Future Retail Location**: Plans mentioned for a physical retail location. Should the integration architecture account for future POS integration?

6. **QuickBooks Edition**: Need confirmation of exact QuickBooks Online subscription level to verify API capabilities.

### 10.2 Assumptions Requiring Validation

1. **Assumption**: All orders will use standard Shopify checkout (no draft orders or POS orders initially)
   - **Validation needed**: Confirm with Sarah

2. **Assumption**: Customer payment method from Shopify is sufficient for QuickBooks tracking
   - **Validation needed**: Confirm with David

3. **Assumption**: Current product naming in both systems is consistent enough for mapping
   - **Validation needed**: Review sample data during discovery call

4. **Assumption**: No multi-currency orders (all USD)
   - **Validation needed**: Confirm current and future plans

### 10.3 Discovery Confidence Score
**Current Implementation Readiness**: 68%

⚠️ **Recommendation**: We recommend additional discovery activities to improve clarity before proceeding to development. See Section 10.1 for specific questions. We will address these during the scheduled discovery call on Thursday, Jan 18 at 2pm.

**Confidence breakdown**:
- Clarity: 65% (several ambiguous requirements around inventory and refunds)
- Completeness: 70% (most core requirements understood, edge cases need definition)
- Alignment: 70% (stakeholder conflict on inventory system of record needs resolution)

### 10.4 Next Steps
1. Discovery call scheduled for Thursday, January 18, 2024 at 2:00 PM (Sarah, David, and Lazer team)
2. Address all open questions in Section 10.1
3. Validate assumptions in Section 10.2
4. Finalize product mapping approach
5. Schedule kick-off meeting upon SOW approval
