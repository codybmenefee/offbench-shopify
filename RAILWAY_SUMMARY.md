# ✅ Railway Deployment Ready!

Your Discovery Agent MCP server is fully configured for Railway deployment.

## 🎯 What Was Configured

### 1. Core Application
- ✅ **Updated `mcp/src/main.py`**: Now reads `PORT` from environment variable
- ✅ **Dynamic Port Binding**: Works with Railway's assigned port
- ✅ **Backward Compatible**: Still works locally on port 8123

### 2. Deployment Files

| File | Purpose | Status |
|------|---------|--------|
| `Procfile` | Tells Railway what command to run | ✅ Ready |
| `railway.json` | Railway configuration (Nixpacks, replicas, restart policy) | ✅ Ready |
| `runtime.txt` | Specifies Python 3.11.9 | ✅ Created |
| `requirements.txt` | Updated with all dependencies | ✅ Updated |
| `.railwayignore` | Excludes unnecessary files from deployment | ✅ Created |

### 3. Documentation
- ✅ **`RAILWAY_DEPLOYMENT.md`**: Complete deployment guide
- ✅ **This file**: Quick reference summary

## 🚀 Quick Deploy

### Option A: Deploy from GitHub (Recommended)

```bash
# 1. Commit and push
git add .
git commit -m "Configure for Railway deployment"
git push origin main

# 2. Go to Railway
# - Visit https://railway.app/new
# - Click "Deploy from GitHub repo"
# - Select your repository
# - Done! Railway will auto-deploy

# 3. Get your URL
# - Dashboard → Settings → Networking → Generate Domain
```

### Option B: Deploy via CLI

```bash
# 1. Install Railway CLI
npm install -g @railway/cli

# 2. Login and deploy
railway login
railway init
railway up

# 3. Generate domain
railway domain
```

```

## 🔍 Configuration Verification

### ✅ Procfile
```
web: cd mcp && python src/main.py
```
- Changes to `mcp` directory
- Runs the main MCP server
- Railway automatically sets `PORT` environment variable

### ✅ railway.json
```json
{
  "build": { "builder": "NIXPACKS" },
  "deploy": {
    "numReplicas": 1,
    "sleepApplication": false,
    "restartPolicyType": "ON_FAILURE",
    "restartPolicyMaxRetries": 10
  }
}
```
- Uses Nixpacks for automatic Python detection
- Keeps application always running (no sleep)
- Auto-restarts on failure (up to 10 retries)

### ✅ Port Configuration
```python
# In mcp/src/main.py
port = int(os.getenv("PORT", 8123))
mcp.run(transport="http", port=port)
```
- Reads `PORT` from environment (Railway provides this)
- Falls back to 8123 for local development

## 📦 What Gets Deployed

**Included** (~2-3 MB):
- ✅ MCP server and all 8 tools
- ✅ Analysis engine and state management
- ✅ 5 test scenarios
- ✅ All templates
- ✅ Core dependencies

**Excluded** (via `.railwayignore`):
- ❌ Virtual environments (`venv/`)
- ❌ Python cache files
- ❌ IDE configurations
- ❌ Vercel-specific files
- ❌ Git metadata

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

After deployment, verify:

1. **Service is running**:
   ```bash
   curl https://your-app.up.railway.app
   ```

2. **MCP tools work**:
   - Configure ChatGPT with your Railway URL
   - Test: "What projects are available?"

3. **Logs are clean**:
   ```bash
   railway logs
   # Or check Railway Dashboard → Deployments
   ```

4. **No errors**:
   - Dashboard should show green ✓ status
   - No restart loops

## 💡 Key Features

| Feature | Railway | Local Dev |
|---------|---------|-----------|
| **URL** | `https://your-app.up.railway.app` | `http://localhost:8123` |
| **Port** | Dynamic (from `PORT` env var) | Fixed (8123) |
| **HTTPS** | ✅ Automatic | ❌ HTTP only |
| **Persistence** | ✅ Always on | ❌ Manual start |
| **SSL** | ✅ Free certificates | ❌ None |
| **Uptime** | ✅ 99.9% SLA | ❌ Depends on local machine |

## 🔐 Security Notes

- **Environment Variables**: Store secrets in Railway dashboard (Settings → Variables)
- **HTTPS**: Railway provides automatic SSL certificates
- **Port Security**: Railway manages port allocation securely
- **Rate Limiting**: Consider adding for production use

## 💰 Cost Estimate

**Free Tier** ($5 credit/month):
- Sufficient for development and light production
- Includes all core features
- This MCP server should use ~$1-2/month with moderate traffic

**Usage Factors**:
- CPU: Minimal (mostly idle)
- RAM: ~100-200 MB
- Bandwidth: Depends on API usage
- Build time: ~1-2 minutes per deploy

## 📚 Resources

- **Full Guide**: `RAILWAY_DEPLOYMENT.md`
- **Railway Docs**: https://docs.railway.app/
- **MCP Usage**: `USAGE_GUIDE.md`
- **Test Prompts**: `TEST_PROMPTS.md`

## 🎉 Success Indicators

When deployment is successful, you'll see:
- ✅ Green checkmark in Railway dashboard
- ✅ Generated domain URL
- ✅ Logs showing "Uvicorn running on 0.0.0.0:XXXX"
- ✅ Health check responds
- ✅ ChatGPT can connect and use tools

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

**Build fails**:
- Check `runtime.txt` has valid Python version
- Verify `requirements.txt` has all dependencies
- Review build logs in Railway dashboard

**Application crashes**:
- Check logs: `railway logs`
- Verify port configuration in `main.py`
- Ensure `Procfile` path is correct

**Can't connect**:
- Verify domain is generated
- Check that service is running (not sleeping)
- Test with `curl https://your-url`

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Deploy**: Choose GitHub or CLI method above
2. **Verify**: Check that service is running
3. **Configure**: Add your Railway URL to ChatGPT
4. **Test**: Run through test scenarios
5. **Monitor**: Watch logs and dashboard
6. **Share**: Give team members your permanent URL
