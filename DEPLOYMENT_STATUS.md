# 🚀 Railway Deployment Status

## ✅ READY TO DEPLOY

Your Discovery Agent MCP server is fully configured for Railway deployment.

---

## 📝 Changes Made

### 1. Updated Application Code
- **File**: `mcp/src/main.py`
- **Change**: Modified port configuration to read from environment variable
- **Code**:
  ```python
  port = int(os.getenv("PORT", 8123))
  mcp.run(transport="http", port=port)
  ```
- **Why**: Railway assigns a dynamic PORT environment variable

### 2. Created Deployment Files

#### `runtime.txt` (NEW)
```
python-3.11.9
```
Specifies Python version for Railway.

#### `requirements.txt` (UPDATED)
Added missing dependencies:
- `openapi-spec-validator>=0.7.0`
- `jsonschema>=4.0.0`

#### `.railwayignore` (NEW)
Excludes unnecessary files from deployment:
- Virtual environments
- Python cache
- IDE configs
- Vercel-specific files
- Development artifacts

### 3. Verified Existing Files

#### `Procfile` ✅
```
web: cd mcp && python src/main.py
```
Already correctly configured.

#### `railway.json` ✅
```json
{
  "$schema": "https://railway.app/railway.schema.json",
  "build": { "builder": "NIXPACKS" },
  "deploy": {
    "numReplicas": 1,
    "sleepApplication": false,
    "restartPolicyType": "ON_FAILURE",
    "restartPolicyMaxRetries": 10
  }
}
```
Already correctly configured.

### 4. Documentation Created

- **`RAILWAY_DEPLOYMENT.md`**: Complete step-by-step deployment guide
- **`RAILWAY_SUMMARY.md`**: Quick reference and configuration overview
- **This file**: Deployment status and changes summary

## 🚀 How to Deploy

### Quick Start (GitHub)

```bash
# 1. Commit these changes
git add .
git commit -m "Configure for Railway deployment"
git push origin main

# 2. Deploy on Railway
# - Go to https://railway.app/new
# - Click "Deploy from GitHub repo"
# - Select: offbench-shopify
# - Railway will auto-deploy

# 3. Generate domain
# - In Railway dashboard: Settings → Networking → Generate Domain
# - You'll get: https://your-app.up.railway.app
```

### Quick Start (CLI)

```bash
# 1. Install Railway CLI
npm install -g @railway/cli

# 2. Login and deploy
railway login
railway init
railway up

# 3. Get your URL
railway domain
```

## ✅ Pre-Deployment Checklist

- ✅ `mcp/src/main.py` reads PORT from environment
- ✅ `runtime.txt` specifies Python 3.11.9
- ✅ `requirements.txt` includes all dependencies
- ✅ `Procfile` configured correctly
- ✅ `railway.json` configured correctly
- ✅ `.railwayignore` excludes dev files
- ✅ No linting errors
- ✅ Documentation complete

---

## 🧪 Testing After Deployment

### 1. Health Check
```bash
curl https://your-app.up.railway.app
```
Should return a successful response.

### 2. Test with ChatGPT
Configure ChatGPT to use your Railway URL and test:
```
What projects are available?
```

### 3. View Logs
```bash
railway logs
# Or in Railway Dashboard → Deployments → View Logs
```

## 📊 Deployment Comparison

| Aspect | Before (Vercel) | Now (Railway) |
|--------|-----------------|---------------|
| **Platform** | Vercel serverless | Railway containers |
| **Configuration** | `vercel.json`, `api/index.py` | `Procfile`, `railway.json` |
| **Port** | Hardcoded 8123 | Dynamic from env |
| **Entry Point** | `api/index.py` wrapper | Direct `main.py` |
| **Build System** | Vercel builder | Nixpacks |
| **Best For** | Serverless functions | Long-running services |

---

## 🎯 What Happens Next

When you deploy to Railway:

1. **Build Phase**:
   - Railway detects Python from `runtime.txt`
   - Installs dependencies from `requirements.txt`
   - Uses Nixpacks builder

2. **Deploy Phase**:
   - Runs command from `Procfile`: `cd mcp && python src/main.py`
   - Sets `PORT` environment variable
   - Your app reads `PORT` and binds to it

3. **Runtime**:
   - Application runs continuously
   - Auto-restarts on failure (up to 10 times)
   - Accessible at your Railway domain

---

## 💰 Estimated Costs

**Free Tier**: $5/month credit
- Sufficient for development and light production
- This MCP server: ~$1-2/month with moderate usage

**Factors**:
- CPU: Minimal (mostly idle)
- RAM: ~100-200 MB
- Network: Depends on API calls
- Build: ~1-2 minutes per deploy

---

## 📚 Documentation

- **Quick Reference**: `RAILWAY_SUMMARY.md`
- **Full Guide**: `RAILWAY_DEPLOYMENT.md`
- **MCP Usage**: `USAGE_GUIDE.md`
- **Test Scenarios**: `SCENARIOS.md`
- **Test Prompts**: `TEST_PROMPTS.md`

---

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Build Fails
- **Check**: `runtime.txt` has valid Python version
- **Check**: All dependencies in `requirements.txt`
- **View**: Build logs in Railway dashboard

### App Crashes
- **Check**: Logs with `railway logs`
- **Check**: PORT configuration in code
- **Check**: `Procfile` command is correct

### Can't Connect
- **Check**: Domain is generated
- **Check**: Service shows "Running" status
- **Test**: `curl https://your-url`

---

## 🎉 Success!

When deployment succeeds:
- ✅ Railway dashboard shows green checkmark
- ✅ Domain URL is accessible
- ✅ Logs show "Uvicorn running on 0.0.0.0:PORT"
- ✅ ChatGPT can connect
- ✅ All MCP tools work
