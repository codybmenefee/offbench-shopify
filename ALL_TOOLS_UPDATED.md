# All Tools Updated with Clear Dependencies ✅

## What I Updated

### ✅ 1. `manage_project` Tool
**Enhanced with**:
- Clear status information ("not_initialized" vs "initialized")
- Prerequisites and next steps guidance
- Better error messages for missing projects

**Agent Guidance**:
```
Status Information:
- "not_initialized": Project exists in storage but not in memory (run ingest() first)
- "initialized": Project is loaded and ready for analysis
```

### ✅ 2. `ingest` Tool  
**Enhanced with**:
- Prerequisites: Project folder must exist, .txt files must be present
- Next steps: Run analyze() after successful ingestion
- Clear examples with scenario project IDs

**Agent Guidance**:
```
Prerequisites:
- Project folder must exist in storage (use manage_project(action="list") to see available projects)
- For local source: .txt files must exist in project subfolders (emails/, transcripts/, client-docs/)

Next Steps:
- After successful ingestion, run analyze() to process the documents
- Use manage_project(action="get") to check project status
```

### ✅ 3. `analyze` Tool
**Enhanced with**:
- Prerequisites: Project must be loaded, documents must be ingested
- Clear error messages telling agent what to do next
- Comprehensive mode descriptions

**Agent Guidance**:
```
Prerequisites:
- Project must be loaded in memory (run ingest() first if needed)
- Documents must be ingested (run ingest() first if needed)

Error Messages:
- "Project 'X' not found in memory. To analyze this project, first run: ingest(project_id='X', source='local')"
- "No documents loaded for X. To analyze this project, first run: ingest(project_id='X', source='local')"
```

### ✅ 4. `update` Tool
**Enhanced with**:
- Prerequisites for different update types
- Clear guidance on when analysis is required
- Next steps after updates

**Agent Guidance**:
```
Prerequisites:
- Project must be loaded in memory (run ingest() first if needed)
- For answer/override/resolve: analysis must exist (run analyze() first)

Types:
- context: Add general information (no prerequisites)
- answer: Answer specific gap/question by ID (requires analysis)
- override: Correct wrong analysis finding (requires analysis)
- resolve: Mark ambiguity/gap as resolved (requires analysis)
```

### ✅ 5. `generate` Tool
**Enhanced with**:
- Prerequisites for different output types
- Clear guidance on when analysis is required
- Next steps for accessing generated files

**Agent Guidance**:
```
Prerequisites:
- Project must be loaded in memory (run ingest() first if needed)
- Analysis must exist (run analyze() first for most output types)
- Exception: analysis_snapshot can be generated without analysis

Output Types:
- sow: Client-facing Statement of Work (requires analysis)
- implementation_plan: Internal implementation plan (requires analysis)
- tech_specs: Technical specifications (requires analysis)
- questions_doc: Formatted questions for client meeting (requires analysis)
- report: Analysis summary with trends (requires analysis)
- analysis_snapshot: JSON export of analysis state (no analysis required)
```

### ✅ 6. `query` Tool
**Enhanced with**:
- Prerequisites for different query types
- Use cases and next steps
- Clear guidance on when analysis is helpful

**Agent Guidance**:
```
Prerequisites:
- Project must be loaded in memory (run ingest() first if needed)
- Documents must be ingested (run ingest() first if needed)
- For analysis insights: analysis must exist (run analyze() first)

Use Cases:
- Search for specific information in documents
- Find mentions of systems, stakeholders, or topics
- Extract pain points and business objectives
- Get insights from analysis results
```

### ✅ 7. `sync_to_convex` Tool
**Enhanced with**:
- Prerequisites for different sync types
- Clear guidance on when analysis is required
- Next steps for accessing synced data

**Agent Guidance**:
```
Prerequisites:
- Project must be loaded in memory (run ingest() first if needed)
- For analysis/questions sync: analysis must exist (run analyze() first)
- Convex must be configured (CONVEX_DEPLOYMENT_URL environment variable)

Sync Types:
- full: Sync everything (metadata, analysis, questions, documents, events)
- metadata: Only project metadata and counts (no prerequisites)
- analysis: Only gaps, conflicts, ambiguities (requires analysis)
- questions: Only extracted questions (requires analysis)
- documents: Only document metadata (requires ingest)
```

## Agent Workflow Examples

### Example 1: Complete Project Analysis
```
User: "Analyze scenario-2-brewcrew and generate a SOW"

Agent Workflow:
1. manage_project(action="get", project_id="scenario-2-brewcrew")
   → Status: "not_initialized"
2. ingest(project_id="scenario-2-brewcrew", source="local")
   → Documents loaded successfully
3. analyze(project_id="scenario-2-brewcrew", mode="full")
   → Analysis complete, confidence: 75%
4. generate(project_id="scenario-2-brewcrew", output_type="sow", template="simplified")
   → SOW generated and saved
```

### Example 2: Quick Information Lookup
```
User: "What did the client say about refunds in scenario-1-cozyhome?"

Agent Workflow:
1. manage_project(action="get", project_id="scenario-1-cozyhome")
   → Status: "not_initialized"
2. ingest(project_id="scenario-1-cozyhome", source="local")
   → Documents loaded successfully
3. query(project_id="scenario-1-cozyhome", question="What did the client say about refunds?")
   → Found relevant excerpts from documents
```

### Example 3: Project Update and Re-analysis
```
User: "The client clarified that they use QB Online, not Desktop. Update the analysis."

Agent Workflow:
1. update(project_id="scenario-1-cozyhome", type="context", content="Client uses QB Online, not Desktop")
   → Context updated successfully
2. analyze(project_id="scenario-1-cozyhome", mode="quick")
   → Confidence improved from 70% to 85%
```

## Benefits

### ✅ Clear Dependencies
- Each tool clearly states what it needs
- Agent knows exactly what to run first
- No more cryptic error messages

### ✅ Flexible Composition
- Agent can choose the right sequence
- Tools can be combined in different ways
- Complex workflows are possible

### ✅ Better Error Handling
- Helpful error messages with next steps
- Clear guidance on prerequisites
- Actionable suggestions for resolution

### ✅ Comprehensive Documentation
- Each tool has detailed descriptions
- Examples show proper usage
- Prerequisites and next steps clearly stated

## Test Results

All tools now provide clear guidance:

```python
# Test: Try to analyze without ingest
result = _analyze_project(project_id="scenario-2-brewcrew", mode="quick")
# Returns: {"error": "No documents loaded for scenario-2-brewcrew. To analyze this project, first run: ingest(project_id='scenario-2-brewcrew', source='local')"}

# Test: Get project status
result = _manage_project(action="get", project_id="scenario-2-brewcrew")
# Returns: {"status": "not_initialized", "documents_loaded": 0}
```

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy these changes** to Railway
2. **Test the agent workflow** with updated prompts
3. **Verify the agent** can handle tool dependencies properly
4. **Use the comprehensive tool descriptions** to guide agent behavior
