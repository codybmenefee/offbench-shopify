# Tool Dependencies & Agent Workflow - IMPLEMENTED ✅

## What I Changed

### ✅ Removed Auto-Loading Complexity
- **Removed** automatic document ingestion from `analyze()` tool
- **Removed** complex auto-initialization logic
- **Simplified** tools to be focused and composable

### ✅ Added Clear Dependency Guidance
- **Updated tool descriptions** to clearly state prerequisites
- **Added error messages** that tell the agent exactly what to do next
- **Added status information** to help the agent understand project state

### ✅ Enhanced Error Messages
Instead of cryptic errors, tools now provide actionable guidance:

**Before**:
```
{"error": "Project not found"}
```

**After**:
```
{"error": "Project 'scenario-2-brewcrew' not found in memory. Available projects: ['scenario-1-cozyhome', 'scenario-2-brewcrew']. To analyze this project, first run: ingest(project_id='scenario-2-brewcrew', source='local')"}
```

### ✅ Updated Test Prompts
- **Added workflow guidance** for complex prompts
- **Added tool dependency section** at the top
- **Showed agent the proper sequence** of tool calls

## How It Works Now

### Agent Workflow for "Show me details of scenario-2-brewcrew"

1. **Agent calls**: `manage_project(action="get", project_id="scenario-2-brewcrew")`
2. **Gets response**: `{"status": "not_initialized", "documents_loaded": 0}`
3. **Agent recognizes**: Project needs to be loaded
4. **Agent calls**: `ingest(project_id="scenario-2-brewcrew", source="local")`
5. **Agent calls**: `analyze(project_id="scenario-2-brewcrew", mode="full")`
6. **Agent presents**: Complete project details to user

### Tool Descriptions Now Include

**`analyze` tool**:
```
Prerequisites:
- Project must be loaded in memory (run ingest() first if needed)
- Documents must be ingested (run ingest() first if needed)
```

**`manage_project` tool**:
```
Status Information:
- "not_initialized": Project exists in storage but not in memory (run ingest() first)
- "initialized": Project is loaded and ready for analysis
```

## Benefits

### ✅ Simpler Tools
- Each tool has a single, clear responsibility
- No complex auto-loading logic
- Easier to debug and maintain

### ✅ Better Agent Guidance
- Clear error messages tell the agent what to do
- Status information helps the agent understand state
- Tool descriptions explain dependencies

### ✅ Flexible Composition
- Agent can choose when to call each tool
- Agent can handle complex workflows
- Tools can be combined in different ways

### ✅ Better Error Handling
- No more cryptic 400/424 errors
- Clear guidance on next steps
- Helpful suggestions for resolution

## Test Results

The tools now provide clear guidance:

```python
# Test: Get project details
result = _manage_project(action="get", project_id="scenario-2-brewcrew")
# Returns: {"status": "not_initialized", "documents_loaded": 0}

# Test: Try to analyze without ingest
result = _analyze_project(project_id="scenario-2-brewcrew", mode="quick")
# Returns: {"error": "No documents loaded for scenario-2-brewcrew. To analyze this project, first run: ingest(project_id='scenario-2-brewcrew', source='local')"}
```

## Updated Test Prompts

The test prompts now include workflow guidance:

```
### Test 1.3: View Project Details
Show me the details of the scenario-2-brewcrew project

Expected Workflow: 
1. Call manage_project(action="get", project_id="scenario-2-brewcrew")
2. If status is "not_initialized", call ingest(project_id="scenario-2-brewcrew", source="local")
3. Call analyze(project_id="scenario-2-brewcrew", mode="full") for complete details
```

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy these changes** to Railway
2. **Test the agent workflow** with the updated prompts
3. **Verify the agent** can handle tool dependencies properly
4. **Use the test prompts** to validate the composable tool approach

---

**Status**: ✅ Implemented  
**Approach**: Composable tools with clear dependencies  
**Agent Guidance**: Clear error messages and workflow instructions  
**Result**: Agent can handle complex workflows by composing simple tools
