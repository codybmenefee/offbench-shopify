# Convex Setup Status Summary

## Issues Fixed ✅

1. **Dependency/CLI Issues** - RESOLVED
   - Removed duplicate nested `convex/convex/` directory
   - Removed conflicting `convex.config.js` file
   - Updated to Convex v1.17.2 (latest)
   - Configured to use `npx convex` instead of global CLI
   - Created `.convexignore` to prevent Node.js built-in bundling errors

2. **Configuration** - RESOLVED
   - Simplified `package.json` scripts
   - Proper `convex.json` configuration
   - Clean TypeScript configuration in `tsconfig.json`
   - Proper `.env` and `.env.local` setup

3. **Deployment** - RESOLVED
   - Successfully deploying to https://determined-cow-114.convex.cloud (prod)
   - Successfully generating `_generated` types
   - All functions compile without errors
   - No more Node.js bundling errors

## Current Issue ⚠️

**Runtime Errors**: All Convex function calls return "Server Error" even though deployment succeeds.

### Symptoms:
- Deployment completes successfully
- All TypeScript compiles without errors  
- But API calls return: `{"status":"error","errorMessage":"[Request ID: ...] Server Error"}`
- This affects both queries and mutations
- Even the simplest `ping:ping` function fails

### What Works:
- ✅ HTTP connectivity to Convex
- ✅ Deployment process
- ✅ Code generation
- ✅ TypeScript compilation
- ✅ Python client can connect

### What Doesn't Work:
- ❌ Function execution (all return runtime errors)
- ❌ Integration tests fail due to `None` returns

### Next Steps:
1. **Check Convex Dashboard Logs**: Visit https://dashboard.convex.dev/d/determined-cow-114 and check function execution logs for detailed error messages
2. **Verify Schema**: Ensure the schema matches what mutations expect
3. **Test Individual Functions**: Use the Convex dashboard to test functions directly
4. **Check for Missing Dependencies**: Verify all imports in functions are available in Convex runtime

## Deployment Commands

### For Development:
```bash
cd mcp/convex
npx convex dev
```

### For Production:
```bash
cd mcp/convex
npx convex deploy
```

## Configuration Files

- **Python**: `/mcp/.env` - Set `CONVEX_DEPLOYMENT_URL=https://determined-cow-114.convex.cloud`
- **Convex CLI**: `/mcp/convex/.env.local` - Managed by Convex CLI
- **Package**: `/mcp/convex/package.json` - Updated to latest Convex

## Test Status

Running: `/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.14/bin/python3 test_convex_integration.py`

Results:
- ✅ Convex Connection - PASS
- ✅ Project Sync - PASS  
- ❌ Analysis Sync - FAIL (returns None)
- ❌ Document Sync - FAIL (returns None)
- ❌ Full Project Sync - FAIL (returns None)
- ✅ Event Logging - PASS

**3/6 tests passing** - Connection works but mutations return None due to server errors

## Recommendations

For this prototype:
1. **Immediate**: Check Convex dashboard for detailed error logs
2. **Fallback**: Consider using Convex's built-in test functions to isolate the issue
3. **Alternative**: Temporarily use in-memory storage while debugging Convex

The core infrastructure is correct - this is a runtime issue that needs dashboard-level debugging.
