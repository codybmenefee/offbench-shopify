# Resolution & Clarification Testing - Quick Start Guide

## Prerequisites

```bash
cd /Users/codymenefee/Documents/Projects/offBench/mcp-servers/clients/shopify/offbench-shopify
source mcp/venv/bin/activate
```

## Run Your First Test

```bash
# Run complete test cycle
python test_resolution_workflow.py --run-full
```

This will:
1. ‚úÖ Ingest 8 discovery documents from `scenario-6-enterprise-full`
2. ‚úÖ Analyze documents for conflicts, ambiguities, and gaps
3. ‚úÖ Detect resolutions and clarifications where they exist
4. ‚úÖ Sync results to Convex (if configured)
5. ‚úÖ Validate against expected results
6. ‚úÖ Display detailed report

## Expected Output

      ‚úÖ CLARIFICATION FOUND: 250,000 orders/month by year 3...

üîµ GAPS:

   1. Return and refund handling not discussed
      Category: business_rules

‚úÖ VALIDATING RESULTS
============================================================

Validating conflicts...
   ‚úÖ Conflict resolution found for 'Inventory System of Record'

Validating ambiguities...
   ‚úÖ Clarification found for 'real-time'
   ‚úÖ Clarification found for 'fast'
   ‚úÖ Clarification found for 'scalable'

Validating gaps...
   ‚úÖ Gap count acceptable: 5 (expected ~5)

Validating confidence score...
   ‚úÖ Confidence score in range: 62.5% (55-70%)

============================================================
‚úÖ ALL VALIDATIONS PASSED
============================================================
```

## Other Test Commands

### Validate Only (without re-running)
```bash
python test_resolution_workflow.py --validate
```

### Clean Data for Fresh Run
```bash
python test_resolution_workflow.py --wipe-only
```

### Run Multiple Iterations (Regression Testing)
```bash
python test_resolution_workflow.py --iterations 3
```

### Test Different Scenario
```bash
python test_resolution_workflow.py --scenario scenario-1-cozyhome --run-full
```

## What to Look For

### ‚úÖ Good Results
- Conflicts have resolutions when they exist in documents
- Ambiguities have clarifications when they exist in documents
- NO resolutions/clarifications when they DON'T exist (no hallucination)
- Confidence score in expected range
- All expected gaps identified

### ‚ùå Problems to Watch For
- Resolution text that doesn't appear in any document (HALLUCINATION)
- Clarification text that's inferred rather than quoted (HALLUCINATION)
- Missing resolutions that clearly exist in documents
- Missing clarifications that clearly exist in documents
- Confidence score way off from expected range

## Next Steps After Testing

1. **Review Results**: Check if AI correctly found resolutions/clarifications
2. **Check Portal**: View results in Convex-connected portal
3. **Adjust Patterns**: If needed, enhance pattern matching in `analyzer.py`
4. **Add More Test Cases**: Create additional scenarios in `test-data/`
5. **Deploy**: Push changes to production

## Troubleshooting

### Test Fails to Run
```bash
# Make sure you're in the right directory
pwd
# Should show: .../offbench-shopify

# Make sure venv is activated
which python
# Should show: .../offbench-shopify/mcp/venv/bin/python

# Install dependencies if needed
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Convex Sync Fails
- Check `mcp/.env` has correct `CONVEX_DEPLOYMENT_URL`
- Verify Convex is running: `cd mcp/convex && convex dev`
- Test will continue without Convex if not configured

### No Resolutions/Clarifications Found
- Check `analyzer.py` pattern matching
- Verify test documents actually contain resolution/clarification text
- Review `expected-results.json` to ensure expectations match document content
