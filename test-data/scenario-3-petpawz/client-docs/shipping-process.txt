========================================

1. DAILY WORKFLOW
-----------------

MORNING SHIFT (8am-12pm)

□ 8:00am - Check Shopify for new orders
  - Filter by: Unfulfilled, Payment: Paid
  - Typically 40-60 orders from overnight

□ 8:15am - Export orders to CSV (ugh)
  - Download from Shopify admin
  - Used to manually import to ShipStation
  - ShipStation import wizard is slow

□ 8:30am - Review orders in ShipStation
  - Check addresses (look for PO boxes, weird addresses)
  - Verify shipping methods selected correctly
  - Flag any problem orders

□ 9:00am - Start printing labels
  - Batch print by carrier (USPS first, usually biggest batch)
  - Then UPS
  - Then FedEx
  - Printer jams frequently - keep an eye on it

□ 9:30am - Warehouse team starts picking & packing
  - Match labels to orders
  - Pull inventory
  - Pack items (bubble wrap for fragile stuff)
  - Affix label
  - Place in carrier-specific staging area

AFTERNOON SHIFT (12pm-5pm)

□ 12:00pm - Check for new orders
  - Usually 20-30 orders by lunch
  - Repeat label printing process

□ 2:00pm - First carrier pickup
  - USPS pickup scheduled for 2pm daily
  - Make sure all USPS orders are ready

□ 3:00pm - UPS pickup
  - UPS driver comes around 3pm (sometimes earlier, sometimes later)

□ 4:00pm - FedEx pickup
  - FedEx usually here 4-4:30pm

□ 4:30pm - Update Shopify with tracking
  - MANUAL PROCESS (this is the pain point!)
  - Jessica or assistant manually enters tracking numbers
  - For each order, mark as fulfilled, add tracking number, select carrier
  - Takes 30-60 minutes for 100 orders
  - Sometimes we skip this if we're behind (bad, I know)

□ 5:00pm - Final order check
  - Any rush orders that came in late?
  - If yes, process and include in tomorrow's first pickup

========================================

2. CARRIER SELECTION RULES (CURRENT MANUAL LOGIC)
--------------------------------------------------

We try to follow these guidelines but it's not enforced:

USPS PRIORITY MAIL
- Default for most orders
- Good for: Lightweight (under 5 lbs), standard shipping
- Cost: Cheapest for most orders
- Speed: 2-5 business days usually

UPS GROUND
- Heavy orders (over 10 lbs)
- Large packages
- Cost: More expensive but better tracking
- Speed: 1-5 business days depending on zone

FEDEX EXPRESS
- Expedited or Express shipping selected
- Guaranteed 2-day or overnight
- Cost: Most expensive
- Speed: Reliable

SPECIAL CASES:
- PO Box addresses → MUST use USPS (only carrier that delivers to PO boxes)
- Hawaii/Alaska → Usually USPS Priority or FedEx (UPS surcharges are crazy)
- Business addresses → Prefer UPS/FedEx (signature options, dock delivery)

========================================

3. LABEL PRINTING
-----------------

Equipment:
- 2 x Zebra label printers (4x6 thermal labels)
- Backup: Regular printer with 8.5x11 paper + tape (emergencies only)

Print Settings:
- 4x6 labels
- Auto-rotate in ShipStation
- Include barcode

Common Issues:
- Printer jam → clear paper path, reload labels
- Low ink warning on backup printer → replace cartridge
- Wrong label size detected → restart printer

Label Verification:
- Scan barcode before affixing to package
- Double-check address visible and legible
- Verify carrier logo matches what we intended

========================================

4. PACKING & QC
---------------

Packing Materials:
- Poly mailers (for soft goods, clothing, light items)
- Cardboard boxes (various sizes for heavier items)
- Bubble wrap (for anything fragile)
- Packing peanuts (for large boxes with small items)
- Branded tissue paper (nice touch, customers love it)

Quality Checks:
- Verify item matches order
- Check for damage before packing
- Include packing slip (print from Shopify)
- Include business card / promo flyer
- Seal securely

Weight Verification:
- Weigh package before affixing label
- If actual weight differs significantly from estimated weight, regenerate label
- Carriers will surcharge if weight is way off

========================================

5. HANDOFF TO CARRIERS
-----------------------

USPS:
- Carrier comes to our location (scheduled daily pickup)
- Scan packages using USPS handheld
- Get pickup receipt
- If we miss pickup, can drop at post office (3 blocks away)

UPS:
- Scheduled daily pickup
- Driver scans packages
- No paperwork needed
- If we miss pickup, can drop at UPS Store (1 mile away)

FedEx:
- Scheduled daily pickup
- Driver scans packages
- Get manifest printout
- If we miss pickup, can drop at FedEx location (2 miles away)

========================================

6. TRACKING UPDATES (PAIN POINT!)
----------------------------------

Current Process:
1. After label is printed, tracking number is in ShipStation
2. Someone (usually Jessica) manually copies tracking to Shopify
3. When marked as fulfilled in Shopify, customer gets email with tracking link

Problems:
- Time-consuming (1 min per order x 100 orders = too long)
- Errors (typos, wrong carrier selected, wrong order)
- Delays (sometimes we don't do this until end of day)
- Customers email asking for tracking

What We Want:
- Automatic sync of tracking from ShipStation back to Shopify
- Immediate notification to customer when label is created
- No manual work

========================================

7. PROBLEM ORDERS
-----------------

Address Issues:
- Invalid address → contact customer, verify, update
- PO Box but UPS selected → switch to USPS, regenerate label
- Military address (APO/FPO) → use USPS only

Out of Stock:
- Inventory discrepancy → contact customer, offer refund or wait
- Partial shipment → ship what's available, note on order, follow up

Shipping Method Mismatch:
- Customer ordered Express but we're behind → upgrade to Express, eat the cost
- Customer ordered Standard but item is hazmat → might need ground only, call to confirm

Fraud / Risk Orders:
- Shopify fraud analysis flags high-risk orders
- We hold these for manual review
- Usually call customer to verify
- About 1-2 per day

========================================

8. RETURNS PROCESS
------------------

Customer Initiates Return:
- Emails support@petpawz.com
- States reason (wrong size, defect, didn't like, etc.)

We Respond:
- Approve return (we're pretty generous)
- Generate return label in ShipStation
  • Manual process: Create new shipment, reverse addresses
  • Usually send prepaid USPS label
- Email label to customer as PDF

Customer Ships Back:
- Uses our prepaid label
- We get tracking notification (eventually)

We Receive Return:
- Inspect item
- Restock if good condition
- Process refund in Shopify (full refund minus original shipping, usually)

Issues with Current Process:
- Totally manual
- No automation
- Tracking return shipments is annoying
- Could this be part of the integration? Would be nice.

========================================

NOTES & TODOS
-------------

TODO: Document international shipping process (when we start doing that)
TODO: Add section on hazmat items (we have some pet products that are restricted)
TODO: Create troubleshooting guide for common ShipStation errors
TODO: Figure out automation for all of this! (hence this Lazer project)
