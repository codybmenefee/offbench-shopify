CUSTOMER SUPPORT NOTES - SHIPPING ISSUES

==============================================================================

OVERVIEW
--------
Tracking-related tickets are our #1 support issue right now. Probably 40% of all customer inquiries.

COMMON CUSTOMER COMPLAINTS
---------------------------

1. "WHERE'S MY TRACKING NUMBER?"
   - Happens when ops team forgets to update Shopify with tracking
   - Or there's a delay (sometimes 6-8 hours after order is packed)
   - Customers expect instant tracking
   - Solution: Automatic sync would fix this

2. "MY TRACKING LINK DOESN'T WORK"
   - Usually because tracking number was entered wrong (typo)
   - Or wrong carrier selected (USPS tracking number but label says UPS)
   - Manual entry errors
   - Solution: Automatic sync would fix this too

3. "IT SAYS DELIVERED BUT I DIDN'T GET IT"
   - Often a wrong address issue
   - Sometimes porch pirates :(
   - Occasionally USPS marks delivered early
   - Not sure if integration helps this, but address validation might?

4. "WHY DID MY ORDER SHIP IN 3 BOXES?"
   - Happens when we have split shipments
   - Customer only gets one tracking number
   - Other packages are a surprise
   - We need better communication about split shipments

5. "CAN YOU HOLD MY PACKAGE FOR PICKUP?"
   - Usually business customers who want office delivery held at UPS/FedEx facility
   - We can do this but have to manually add instructions in ShipStation
   - Would be nice if customer could specify at checkout?

SHIPPING NOTIFICATION TIMING
-----------------------------
Currently:
- Order placed → immediate confirmation email (good)
- Order ships → tracking email... eventually? (bad)

The delay is because Jessica or her team has to manually update Shopify after printing labels. If they're busy packing, this can take hours. Sometimes until end of day.

Customers email us asking for tracking within 2-3 hours of ordering. They're impatient. Can't blame them.

IDEAL: Tracking email goes out within 30 minutes of label printing.

CARRIER PREFERENCE ISSUES
--------------------------
Some customers hate certain carriers.

Example: Rural customers prefer USPS (delivers to PO boxes, goes everywhere)
Example: Business customers prefer UPS/FedEx (signature required options)

We don't have a way for customers to specify carrier preference. Should we?

DAMAGED SHIPMENTS
------------------
Get maybe 2-3 per week. Usually:
- Glass items (water bowls, treat jars)
- Products with fragile parts

Customers email photos of damaged items. We usually:
1. Issue immediate refund or send replacement
2. File claim with carrier (pain in the butt)
3. Add note to account

Is there a way to track which carriers damage stuff most? That would help us choose better carriers.

RETURNS & EXCHANGES
--------------------
Return process is pretty manual:

Customer emails → we respond with return instructions → generate return label in ShipStation → email label to customer → customer ships back → we process refund

Takes 2-3 back-and-forth emails per return.

Would be nice to have automated return portal:
- Customer logs in, selects order, requests return
- System generates label automatically
- Emails it to them
- Notifies us

Is that part of this project? Probably not but throwing it out there.

INTERNATIONAL ORDERS
--------------------
Wait - do we even ship internationally? 

I just realized I've never seen an international order. We might not have that enabled in Shopify? Or maybe our products just aren't popular outside the US?

Should probably confirm this with Jessica. If we do start international shipping, customs forms are a whole other thing.

SUPPORT TICKET VOLUME
----------------------
Average: 80-100 tickets/day
Shipping-related: 30-40 tickets/day

If we can cut shipping inquiries in half through automation, that would be HUGE for our team.

CUSTOMER EXPECTATIONS
----------------------
Our customers are pet owners. They love their pets. They want:
- Fast shipping (Amazon Prime has ruined everyone)
- Accurate tracking
- Proactive communication
- Easy returns

Right now we're batting like .500 on those. Better automation would help us get to .900.

OTHER NOTES
-----------
- We use Gorgias for customer support (integrates with Shopify already)
- Most inquiries come through email, some through chat widget on site
- Phone support for complex issues only

- Peak season (Oct-Dec) our ticket volume doubles
- This year we had to bring on 3 temp support reps just to keep up
- Better automation = fewer temps needed

QUESTIONS FOR INTEGRATION PROJECT
----------------------------------
- Will automation reduce tracking-related tickets?
- Can we expose tracking info in customer account page on site?
- What happens if label creation fails? Does customer still get a notification?
- Can we track which orders have issues and proactively reach out?

Let me know if you need clarification on any of this.
