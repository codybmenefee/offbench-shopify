PETPAWZ OPERATIONS - PAIN POINTS & REQUIREMENTS
From: Jessica Martinez, Operations Lead

==============================================================================

CURRENT SITUATION
-----------------
We're drowning in manual work. Our order volume has grown way faster than we expected (which is good!) but our processes haven't kept up.

DAILY WORKFLOW (PAINFUL)
-------------------------
1. Wake up, check Shopify for new orders (~40-60 overnight)
2. Log into ShipStation 
3. Manually import each order
4. Select shipping method for each one (USPS vs UPS vs FedEx - it's not automatic)
5. Print labels (printer jams at least 3 times per day)
6. Pack orders
7. Go back to Shopify and mark each order as fulfilled (THIS TAKES FOREVER)
8. Copy tracking numbers back to Shopify one by one
9. Repeat for afternoon orders
10. Stay late because we got behind

This process takes me and my assistant roughly 3-4 hours JUST on the label/tracking part.

WHAT WE NEED
------------
• Orders should automatically flow from Shopify to ShipStation when customer pays
• Shipping method should be pre-selected based on some logic (see below)
• When label is created, tracking info needs to go back to Shopify automatically
• Customer should get tracking email (Shopify handles this if we update it properly)

SHIPPING CARRIERS WE USE
-------------------------
• USPS Priority Mail - most orders, affordable, reliable enough
• UPS Ground - heavy orders (over 5 lbs? over 10 lbs? idk the exact cutoff)
• FedEx Express - rush orders (we offer 2-day shipping as an upgrade)

We have accounts with all three. ShipStation supports them all.

Problem: Right now I manually decide which carrier to use for each order. I'd love to have this automated based on:
- Weight
- Customer's chosen shipping speed
- Maybe cost? (ShipStation can compare rates)

PRODUCT WEIGHT INFO
--------------------
Most of our products are light (dog toys, cat toys, small accessories) - under 1 lb
Some products are heavier:
- Large dog beds (8-15 lbs)
- Bulk treat bags (3-5 lbs)
- Crates and carriers (varies, 10-25 lbs)

Shopify has weight info for most products. Some older products are missing it.

SHIPPING SPEEDS WE OFFER
-------------------------
• Standard (5-7 business days) - Free over $50, otherwise $5.95
• Expedited (2-3 business days) - $12.95
• Express (1-2 business days) - $24.95

VOLUME
------
Current: ~100 orders/day average
Peak (holidays): Can hit 200-250/day in November/December
Growing about 20% month over month

WHAT WORKS / WHAT DOESN'T
--------------------------
ShipStation is actually pretty good. The problem is getting data in and out of it without manual work.

Shopify notifications work fine when we remember to update tracking.

Main issues:
1. Manual entry is error-prone (I've shipped to wrong addresses by copying wrong order)
2. Time consuming
3. Tracking numbers sometimes don't get back to Shopify, customers email asking "where's my order?"
4. Can't keep up with growth

EDGE CASES / QUESTIONS
-----------------------
• What happens if ShipStation is down? (Happened once last month)
• What about orders with multiple items that need multiple packages?
• Some customers request hold for pickup at FedEx/UPS locations - how do we handle that?
• Address validation - ShipStation does this, should we auto-correct or alert us?

RETURNS
-------
We get maybe 5-10 returns per week. Usually wrong size, or pet didn't like it, or arrived damaged.

Currently we:
1. Customer emails us
2. We send them a return label (generate manually in ShipStation)
3. When item comes back, we process refund in Shopify

This should probably stay manual? Or could it be automated too? Not sure if that's part of this project.

NICE TO HAVES (if possible)
----------------------------
• Automatically batch orders by carrier for easier handoff to shipping area
• Print packing slips with labels (ShipStation can do this)
• Alert us if an order hasn't shipped within 24 hours
• Some kind of dashboard showing daily shipping metrics

CONCERNS
--------
• Can't have downtime - if the integration breaks, we need a backup plan
• API limits - does ShipStation have rate limits? What happens if we hit them?
• Cost - what's the monthly cost for this integration to run?

TIMELINE
--------
We need this ASAP. Every day we delay costs us hours of labor.
Ideally live by end of February? Is that realistic?
