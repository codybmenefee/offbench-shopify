[09:23 AM] Jessica Martinez
Morning team - quick question. Has anyone else noticed ShipStation being slow today? Labels are taking forever to generate.

[09:24 AM] Alex Kim
yeah i noticed that too. thought it was just our internet

[09:25 AM] Jessica Martinez
Checked internet, we're fine. Might be ShipStation API or something. I'll reach out to their support.

[09:26 AM] Mike Thompson
Great, because we're already getting "where's my tracking number" emails from last night's orders üòÖ

[09:27 AM] Jessica Martinez
I know, I know. That's why we need this integration project. Can't keep doing this manually.

[09:45 AM] Jessica Martinez
Update: ShipStation support says they had a brief outage this morning. Should be back to normal now. Testing...

[09:47 AM] Jessica Martinez
Yep, working now. OK let's catch up on these labels.

[10:15 AM] Alex Kim
@Jessica Martinez we have a problem order. #PZ-4728 - customer ordered 3 large dog beds. That's going to be like 35-40 lbs total. Too big for one box.

[10:16 AM] Jessica Martinez
Split it into 2 shipments. 2 beds in one, 1 in another. Use UPS for both since they're heavy.

[10:17 AM] Alex Kim
ok but customer only paid for standard shipping. ups ground?

[10:18 AM] Jessica Martinez
Yeah UPS Ground is fine for standard. We just eat the extra cost on the second package.

[10:19 AM] Alex Kim
got it. but then the customer only gets tracking for one package right? unless you enter both tracking numbers?

[10:20 AM] Jessica Martinez
Ugh you're right. I'll make sure to add both tracking numbers to the order. This is exactly the kind of thing that slips through the cracks.

[10:21 AM] Mike Thompson
Maybe note somewhere in the order that it's a split shipment? So if they call we know?

[10:22 AM] Jessica Martinez
Good idea. I'll add an order note in Shopify. "Split shipment - 2 packages"

[11:34 AM] Alex Kim
Another question - order #PZ-4891 is going to a PO Box but we already printed a UPS label. What do?

[11:35 AM] Jessica Martinez
Void the UPS label. Print new USPS label. This is why we need address validation...

[11:36 AM] Alex Kim
how do i void the label?

[11:37 AM] Jessica Martinez
In ShipStation, find the order, click the three dots, "Void Label". Then regenerate with USPS selected.

[11:38 AM] Alex Kim
done. but we already wasted a ups label. do we get charged for that?

[11:39 AM] Jessica Martinez
Only if it gets scanned by UPS. Since we voided it before that, we should be OK. But yeah, another reason we need automation to catch PO boxes up front.

[02:47 PM] Mike Thompson
Quick update from support side - we're getting a LOT of tracking inquiries today. More than usual. Is there a delay on updating Shopify?

[02:48 PM] Jessica Martinez
Yeah sorry Mike. We got behind on label printing because of the ShipStation issue this morning. I'm updating tracking numbers now but it takes forever.

[02:49 PM] Mike Thompson
All good, just letting you know. Is there a way I can see which orders have labels printed but not updated in Shopify? So I can at least manually send tracking to customers who ask?

[02:51 PM] Jessica Martinez
Not easily. I'd have to export from ShipStation and compare to Shopify. Takes time I don't have right now.

[02:52 PM] Mike Thompson
No worries. This is definitely on the list of things for the integration project to fix.

[02:53 PM] Jessica Martinez
TOP OF THE LIST üéØ

[03:15 PM] Alex Kim
usps driver is here, handing off 67 packages

[03:16 PM] Jessica Martinez
Nice! Make sure you get the pickup receipt.

[03:17 PM] Alex Kim
‚úÖ got it

[03:45 PM] Alex Kim
ups driver came early today. handed off 23 packages. he was in a hurry lol

[03:46 PM] Jessica Martinez
Classic UPS

[04:22 PM] Alex Kim
fedex pickup done. 8 packages. slow day for fedex.

[04:23 PM] Jessica Martinez
We don't get many express orders mid-week. More on Fridays usually.

[04:35 PM] Jessica Martinez
OK I just finished updating all tracking numbers in Shopify. 98 orders today. Took me 45 minutes. MY FINGERS HURT.

[04:36 PM] Mike Thompson
üèÜ hero

[04:37 PM] Alex Kim
seriously we need that automation like yesterday

[04:38 PM] Jessica Martinez
Meeting with Lazer Technologies next week to kick off the project. I'm going to bring all these examples of manual work we're doing.

[04:40 PM] Mike Thompson
Please do. And mention the customer complaints. We need to show the business case.

[04:41 PM] Jessica Martinez
Oh trust me, I have a whole document prepared. üòÇ

[04:42 PM] Alex Kim
when do they think it'll be ready? we're growing so fast we're going to have to hire another person just for label printing if we don't fix this soon

[04:43 PM] Jessica Martinez
TBD. Hoping by end of Feb but we'll see what they say. It's probably more complex than we think.

[04:44 PM] Mike Thompson
Even if it just automates the tracking sync, that would be huge.

[04:45 PM] Jessica Martinez
üíØ agreed. Even if we still have to print labels manually, automatic tracking would save us probably 30-45 min a day.

[04:46 PM] Alex Kim
plus fewer mistakes. i've definitely grabbed the wrong label before and had to redo it.

[04:48 PM] Jessica Martinez
OK team, wrapping up for today. Same time tomorrow! üì¶üì¶üì¶

[04:49 PM] Mike Thompson
see ya üëã

[04:49 PM] Alex Kim
later ‚úåÔ∏è
