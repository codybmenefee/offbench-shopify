3. FURNITURE (FU)
-----------------
Subcategories:
- Shelving (SHE)

FU-TAB-OAK36 - Oak Side Table 36" - $195

Inventory management: These don't actually sync inventory counts since they're drop-shipped. We just mark them as available unless supplier tells us otherwise.

==============================================================================

4. ACCESSORIES (AC)
-------------------
Subcategories:
- Vases (VAS)
- Trays (TRA)
- Frames (FRA)

==============================================================================

QUICKBOOKS MAPPING
------------------

In QuickBooks, David set up Classes that sort of match our categories but not exactly:
- Wall Art (maps to WA)
- Textiles (maps to TX)
- Furniture (maps to FU)
- Accessories & Lighting (maps to AC and LT combined)

Income accounts:
- Product Sales - Wall Art
- Product Sales - Textiles  
- Product Sales - Furniture
- Product Sales - Other

Sarah's note: This mapping isn't perfect and causes some confusion. Some products could fit multiple categories. For example, decorative wall shelves - are those Furniture or Accessories?

==============================================================================

PRICING NOTES
-------------
- Prices in Shopify include taxes (set to auto-calculate based on customer location)
- We offer discount codes frequently (10-25% off)
- Free shipping on orders $75+ 
- How does shipping cost get recorded in QuickBooks? Need to ask David.

==============================================================================

CURRENT INVENTORY PROCESS
--------------------------
When new products arrive:
1. Sarah counts items
2. Updates Shopify inventory
3. Emails David with counts
4. David updates QuickBooks

When products sell:
- Shopify automatically decrements
- Sarah emails David weekly (sometimes) with sales
- David manually decrements QB (sometimes gets behind)

This is why we keep having syncing issues!

==============================================================================

FUTURE PLANS
------------
- Adding more local artisan partnerships (could add 50-100 SKUs this year)
- Retail location planned for Q3 2024 (will that be separate inventory?)
- Possibly adding gift bundles (how do bundles work with inventory tracking?)

==============================================================================

NOTES
-----
This is an internal working document. Some information may be out of date.
Our actual SKU count is probably closer to 280 now, not 250.
