Hi Sarah,

Thanks for reaching out! We definitely can help with this. Shopify to QuickBooks integrations are one of our specialties.

I'd love to set up a quick call to understand your workflow better. A few quick questions:
- Are you on QuickBooks Online or Desktop?
- Do you need real-time syncing or would daily batches work?
- Besides orders and inventory, anything else you'd like synced?

Let me know what times work for you this week.

Best,
Marcus Williams
Solutions Consultant

Hi Marcus,

Great! We're on QuickBooks Online. Real-time would be ideal because I'm constantly checking both systems throughout the day. 

As for what else to sync - good question. I think mostly just the orders and inventory. Oh, and it would be nice to get a daily sales summary into QuickBooks too, that would help a lot.

I should probably loop in my accountant David on this conversation. Let me add him.

Available for a call Thursday afternoon or Friday morning?

Adding David Rodriguez, my accountant.

David - this is about that integration project we talked about. Can you weigh in on what you'd need from a QuickBooks perspective?

Morning all,

Good to be looped in. From an accounting standpoint, here's what I need:

1. Each Shopify order needs to create an invoice in QuickBooks with the correct customer, line items, and tax information
2. Inventory quantities in QuickBooks should be the source of truth - when we do physical counts, I update QB and that should flow to Shopify
3. We need clean daily sales reports that roll up to the right income accounts

Some technical stuff to consider:
- We use QB classes for different product categories (wall art, textiles, furniture, accessories)
- Customer records need to match between systems or we'll have duplicates
- Payment information should sync too - whether it's credit card, PayPal, etc.

One thing Sarah - I thought you were managing inventory in Shopify, not QuickBooks? We should clarify that before moving forward.

Available for a call Thursday 2pm or Friday 10am.

David - I do update Shopify inventory when we get new products in, but you're right that you adjust it during the counts. Maybe we need both to sync? I don't know, this is getting confusing.

Marcus - can you help us figure out the best way to handle this on Thursday? Let's do 2pm. I'll send a Zoom link.

Also just thought of something - we're planning to add a retail location later this year. Would that impact how we set this up?

Sarah
