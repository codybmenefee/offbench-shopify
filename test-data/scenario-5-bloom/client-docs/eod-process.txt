BLOOM & CO. END-OF-DAY CLOSING PROCESS
Written by: Priya Sharma, Shop Manager
Date: January 18, 2024
For: Lazer Technologies Integration Project

==============================================================================

OVERVIEW
--------
This document describes our current end-of-day closing procedure. We close at 5:30pm daily (6pm on Fridays). The entire process usually takes 45-60 minutes.

My goal with the new integration is to cut this down to 30 minutes or less.

==============================================================================

STEP 1: CLOSE THE SHOP
-----------------------
Time: 5:30pm
Duration: ~5 minutes

- Flip "Open" sign to "Closed"
- Lock front door
- Turn off storefront lights (but keep back office lights on)
- Finish helping any lingering customers (we don't kick people out mid-purchase)
- Make sure all in-store purchases are completed in the POS

Notes:
- Sometimes we have a late rush around 5:15pm (people buying flowers on their way home)
- On busy days we don't actually close till 5:45pm

==============================================================================

STEP 2: COUNT CASH DRAWER
--------------------------
Time: 5:35pm
Duration: ~10 minutes

- Remove cash drawer from register
- Count bills by denomination (20s, 10s, 5s, 1s)
- Count coins
- Separate out the "starting cash" amount ($100 in small bills)
- Put starting cash back in drawer for tomorrow
- Put excess cash in envelope for bank deposit

Expected cash: [whatever FloralPOS says we collected in cash today]
Actual cash: [what we counted]

If they match → great!
If they don't match → recount, check for errors, make note in discrepancy log

Notes:
- We rarely have discrepancies (maybe once a month)
- Most customers pay by card anyway, cash is only like 20% of transactions

==============================================================================

STEP 3: RECONCILE CASH WITH POS
--------------------------------
Time: 5:45pm
Duration: ~5 minutes

- Log into FloralPOS admin on the iPad
- Go to End-of-Day Report
- Check: "Cash Sales Today: $XXX"
- Compare with actual cash counted
- If discrepancy, make adjustment note in POS

FloralPOS has a field for "Cash Over/Short" where we log the difference.

Notes:
- This is important for accounting
- Linda's accountant wants to see this tracked
- Small discrepancies (<$5) are usually coins we missed or gave as change

==============================================================================

STEP 4: RUN POS END-OF-DAY REPORT
----------------------------------
Time: 5:50pm
Duration: ~5 minutes

- Still in FloralPOS admin
- Click "Generate End-of-Day Report"
- Report shows:
  • Total sales (broken down by payment type)
  • Number of transactions
  • Best-selling products
  • Sales by category
  • Tax collected

- Print report (sometimes, if printer works)
- Or email report to myself and Linda

Notes:
- This report is just for FloralPOS (in-store) sales
- Doesn't include Shopify (online) sales
- We use this to track daily performance and inventory movement

==============================================================================

STEP 5: CHECK SHOPIFY FOR ONLINE ORDERS
----------------------------------------
Time: 5:55pm
Duration: ~10 minutes

- Log into Shopify admin on the back office computer
- Check: Orders > Unfulfilled
- See if any new orders came in during the day
- For each order:
  1. Check if item is in stock (look at physical inventory)
  2. If yes, mark order as "ready for pickup" or "ready to pack"
  3. If no, email customer about out-of-stock (ugh, this happens too often)

- Also check: Today's Shopify sales total
  • Dashboard shows: "Today's Sales: $XXX"
  • Write this number down

Notes:
- Most online orders are for next-day pickup, so we don't have to fulfill immediately
- But I like to check so we can prepare for tomorrow morning
- Occasionally someone orders online and shows up 20 min later expecting it ready (annoying)

==============================================================================

STEP 6: PACKAGE ORDERS FOR TOMORROW
------------------------------------
Time: 6:05pm
Duration: ~15 minutes (varies by # of orders)

- For orders marked "ready for pickup":
  • Pull items from inventory
  • Create arrangement or bouquet if it's a custom order
  • Add gift card if customer requested one
  • Package in bag or box
  • Attach label with customer name and order number
  • Place in "pickup" area at front desk

- For delivery orders:
  • Same process but note "DELIVERY" on label
  • Set aside for Linda to deliver tomorrow

Notes:
- We usually have 2-5 pickup orders waiting at any given time
- Delivery is 1-2 per week max
- If order requires flowers we don't have, we skip this step and handle in the morning

==============================================================================

STEP 7: INVENTORY FRESHNESS CHECK ("THE WALK")
-----------------------------------------------
Time: 6:20pm
Duration: ~10 minutes

- Walk through the shop and inspect all fresh flowers
- Look for:
  • Wilting petals
  • Brown edges
  • Dried stems
  • Overall "sad" appearance

- For flowers past their prime:
  • Remove from display
  • Either mark down 50% (if still sellable)
  • Or set aside for donation (if too wilted)

- Update inventory counts in FloralPOS
  • Manually adjust quantity down for removed items
  • Example: Had 12 tulips, removed 3 wilted ones, update to 9

Notes:
- THIS IS CRITICAL but I don't always do it
- If I'm tired or in a hurry, I skip the inventory update part
- Which is why we oversell things (I know, I know)
- An automated system would be great but I don't see how tech can tell if a flower is wilted

==============================================================================

STEP 8: MANUAL INVENTORY UPDATE (OPTIONAL)
-------------------------------------------
Time: 6:30pm
Duration: ~10 minutes (when I actually do it)

- If I removed a lot of flowers during "the walk", I update Shopify inventory too
  • Log into Shopify
  • Go to Products > Inventory
  • Manually adjust quantities to match what's actually in the shop

- But honestly? I only do this maybe twice a week
- Linda does a "full inventory sync" on Sunday evenings
- Which is why our Shopify inventory is often wrong midweek

Notes:
- This step is the biggest pain point
- If the integration could auto-sync inventory from FloralPOS to Shopify, this would save SO much time
- I'd still need to do "the walk" to remove wilted flowers, but at least the sync would be automatic

==============================================================================

STEP 9: COMBINED SALES REPORT (FOR LINDA)
------------------------------------------
Time: 6:40pm
Duration: ~5 minutes

- Linda wants to know daily sales across BOTH channels (in-store + online)
- So I:
  1. Look at FloralPOS report: "Today's total: $XXX"
  2. Look at Shopify dashboard: "Today's sales: $YYY"
  3. Open Google Sheets (Linda's "Daily Sales Tracker")
  4. Add a new row with today's date
  5. Enter POS sales, Shopify sales, and total
  6. Save spreadsheet

- Linda looks at this every morning to track performance

Notes:
- This is so manual and feels dumb
- A combined report would be WAY better
- Linda's accountant also needs these numbers for monthly books

==============================================================================

STEP 10: FINAL SHOP CHECK & LOCK UP
------------------------------------
Time: 6:45pm
Duration: ~5 minutes

- Walk through shop one more time
- Make sure:
  • No customers hiding somewhere (kidding, but I check)
  • All lights off in customer area
  • Cooler is running (for overnight flower storage)
  • Back door is locked
  • Alarm is set

- Lock front door
- Go home!

==============================================================================

TOTAL TIME: 60-75 minutes

If we could automate:
- Inventory sync between POS and Shopify (saves 10-15 min)
- Combined sales reporting (saves 5 min)
- Faster online order checking (saves 5 min)

New total time: ~40 minutes

That would be HUGE.

==============================================================================

QUESTIONS FOR INTEGRATION PROJECT
----------------------------------

1. Can the integration automatically sync inventory from FloralPOS to Shopify after I update it?
   - Ideally in real-time or at least every 15 minutes

2. Can we get an automated daily sales report that combines POS + Shopify?
   - Email would be perfect
   - Include: Date, POS sales, Shopify sales, total, tax collected

3. Can Shopify orders automatically notify us faster?
   - Right now we have to manually check
   - Email or text notification would be great

4. What happens if I forget to update inventory in FloralPOS?
   - Will Shopify just show whatever's in the system?
   - Or is there a way to alert us about discrepancies?

5. Can we set a buffer for online inventory?
   - Like show 2 fewer items online than we actually have
   - To prevent overselling due to timing issues

6. Is there a way to track which products sell best online vs in-store?
   - Linda would love this data for inventory planning

==============================================================================

NOTES
-----
- This document reflects our CURRENT process, which is very manual
