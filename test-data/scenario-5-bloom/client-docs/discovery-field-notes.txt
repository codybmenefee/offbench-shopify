DISCOVERY FIELD NOTES - BLOOM & CO.
Site Visit: January 12, 2024
Consultant: Sophie Chen, Lazer Technologies
Location: Bloom & Co. Flower Shop, 342 Main St, Portland OR

==============================================================================

GENERAL OBSERVATIONS
--------------------
- Small storefront, ~800 sq ft
- 2 employees working during my visit (owner Linda + shop manager Priya)
- Busy! 8 customers came in during my 90-min visit
- Beautiful displays (professionally done, Linda has good eye for design)
- POS system visible at checkout counter (iPad-based, brand name: FloralPOS)
- Computer in back office for "online stuff" (Shopify)

CURRENT WORKFLOW - IN-STORE SALES
----------------------------------
Customer walks in → browses/gets help → makes selection → checkout at counter

POS System (FloralPOS):
- Scan barcode OR search by product name
- System shows price, inventory count
- Process payment (card or cash)
- Print receipt
- System auto-decrements inventory

Simple enough. Works well for in-store.

CURRENT WORKFLOW - ONLINE SALES
--------------------------------
Customer orders via Shopify → Email notification to Linda → She fulfills from shop

Problems:
1. Shopify inventory is MANUALLY updated (Linda does this weekly, sometimes less)
2. "We keep overselling tulips" - exact quote from shop manager
3. Customer orders online, comes to pick up, item is sold out
4. Awkward conversation, have to refund or substitute

Major pain point here. THIS is why they need integration.

INVENTORY MANAGEMENT CHAOS
---------------------------
Two separate inventory systems = constant headaches

FloralPOS Inventory:
- Updated in real-time at point of sale
- Linda says this is "accurate-ish"
- Does NOT account for flowers that are past their prime (see below)

Shopify Inventory:
- Updated manually by Linda
- Usually on Sunday evenings
- Often wrong by Wednesday
- Priya: "I just tell online customers to call first if they want something specific"

WHICH SHOULD BE SOURCE OF TRUTH?
Linda thinks POS (updated more frequently)
Priya thinks Shopify (that's where online orders come from)
No clear answer. NEED TO RESOLVE THIS.

PERISHABLE INVENTORY PROBLEM
-----------------------------
(This is a BIG deal that I don't think they've fully thought through)

Flowers don't last forever. They have:
- Roses: ~5-7 day shelf life
- Tulips: ~3-5 days
- Sunflowers: ~7-10 days
- Orchids: ~2 weeks (more stable)

Current process:
- Linda walks the shop each morning
- Identifies flowers past prime
- Removes them from display
- Marks them down OR donates to local nursing home

But - she doesn't always update inventory counts when she does this!

So POS says "12 tulips" but really only 8 are sellable.

Shopify has no idea about flower freshness at all.

Question for integration: How do we handle this?
- Real-time freshness tracking (probably too complex for v1)
- Buffer stock (online inventory always shows less than actual to account for waste)
- Manual daily adjustments (defeats the purpose of automation)

TBD.

PRODUCT CATALOG
---------------
~150 SKUs total

Categories:
- Fresh Cut Flowers (single stems and bunches)
- Bouquets (pre-made arrangements)
- Plants (potted plants, succulents)
- Supplies (vases, plant food, cards)

Mixed perishability:
- Flowers: highly perishable
- Plants: somewhat perishable
- Supplies: not perishable

Integration needs to distinguish these.

POS has product types set up correctly.
Shopify... less organized. Linda admits she "just threw products in there" when setting up the store.

PRICING
-------
Prices are supposed to match between POS and Shopify.
In practice? Priya found 3 products with different prices during our walk-through.
- Sunflowers: $2.50 in POS, $2.99 in Shopify
- Rose bouquet: $45 in POS, $42 in Shopify (!!!)
- Ceramic vase: $18 in POS, $18 in Shopify (this one matches)

Who's right? Linda says POS prices are correct. Need to sync pricing too.

PAYMENT PROCESSING
------------------
In-store: FloralPOS handles credit cards (integrated with some processor, didn't catch the name)
Online: Shopify Payments

No integration between these payment systems. That's fine, they're separate.

But Linda wants to see TOTAL sales across both channels in one place.
Currently she:
1. Exports POS daily report (PDF)
2. Checks Shopify sales dashboard
3. Manually adds them up in a spreadsheet
4. Sends to her accountant

Takes her 15-20 minutes every day. Would love to automate this.

END-OF-DAY CLOSING PROCESS
---------------------------
(Linda walked me through this, it's... a process)

5:30pm - Close shop
5:35pm - Count cash drawer, reconcile with POS
5:45pm - Run POS end-of-day report
5:50pm - Check Shopify for any new orders
6:00pm - Package any orders for tomorrow's pickup/delivery
6:10pm - Walk the shop, check flower freshness (remove wilted ones)
6:20pm - Update inventory counts if needed (she usually doesn't)
6:30pm - Lock up and go home

She wants this to be faster and more accurate.

DELIVERY & PICKUP
-----------------
In-store purchases: customer takes item immediately

Online purchases: 
- Local delivery (within 5 miles) - Linda or Priya delivers
- Customer pickup - customer comes to shop (90% of online orders)

No integration with delivery services (no DoorDash or anything).
It's very manual and small-scale.

Priya: "Sometimes people order online and show up 10 minutes later expecting their flowers ready. We haven't even seen the order yet!"

Need faster notification system? Or set expectations better on Shopify?

TAX HANDLING
------------
(Didn't get deep into this, but flagging it)

Sales tax is collected in both systems.
POS: automatically calculates based on Oregon tax rules
Shopify: also set up for OR tax

But Linda said her accountant complained last quarter about "discrepancies" in tax reporting.
Didn't dig into details but sounds like the two systems report differently.

Integration should probably include tax reconciliation? Or at least make sure both systems report consistently?

FUTURE PLANS
------------
Linda mentioned wanting to open a second location within the next year.
"Maybe in the Pearl District, somewhere with more foot traffic"

If that happens, they'll need to track inventory across TWO physical locations plus online.
That's way more complex. Out of scope for v1 but good to know for architecture planning.

TECHNICAL DETAILS - POS SYSTEM
-------------------------------
Brand: FloralPOS (cloud-based)
Hardware: iPad at checkout
Internet: Yes (required for cloud POS)
Support: Vendor support available

Does it have an API?
Linda: "I think so? The sales guy mentioned it."
Priya: "We have a login to their dashboard if that helps."

NEED TO GET API SPECS FROM FLORALPOS VENDOR.
Linda said she'd connect me with their account rep.

TECHNICAL DETAILS - SHOPIFY
----------------------------
Plan: Basic Shopify (might need to upgrade for API access?)
Theme: Some free theme
Customizations: Minimal
Apps: Just POS integration prep (nothing installed yet)

PAIN POINTS SUMMARY
-------------------
1. OVERSELLING (biggest issue) - Shopify inventory doesn't match reality
2. MANUAL WORK - Linda spends hours each week updating inventory
3. REPORTING - No unified view of sales across channels
4. FRESHNESS - No way to track perishable inventory automatically
5. PRICING - Inconsistencies between systems

SUCCESS CRITERIA (per Linda)
-----------------------------
"I want to stop apologizing to customers for selling them flowers we don't have."
"I want to close out my day in 30 minutes instead of an hour."
"I want to know how much money I'm actually making without doing math every night."

QUESTIONS TO FOLLOW UP ON
--------------------------
- FloralPOS API capabilities (waiting on vendor response)
- How to handle perishable inventory in automation
- Which system should be source of truth for inventory
- Tax reconciliation requirements
- Do they want same-day order fulfillment or next-day?
- How much historical data to migrate (if any)
- What happens when POS is offline? (Internet outage)
- Do they want alerts for low inventory?

BUDGET & TIMELINE
------------------
Linda: "I don't have a huge budget. What's realistic?"
Me: "Probably $8k-12k depending on complexity."
Linda: "Ouch. But if it saves me 10 hours a week, that's worth it."

Timeline: She wants it done by spring (their busy season). That's March-ish.
Tight but doable if we start soon.

NEXT STEPS
----------
1. Get FloralPOS API docs from vendor
2. Schedule three-way call (Linda, Priya, FloralPOS rep, Lazer team)
3. Document their end-of-day process in detail (Linda will write this up)
4. Clean up Shopify product catalog (Linda's homework)
5. Proposal with phased approach

GENERAL IMPRESSION
------------------
Small business with big ambitions. Linda is smart and motivated but stretched thin.
They need this integration to scale.

Current setup is held together with duct tape and manual work.
Good opportunity for Lazer to add real value here.
