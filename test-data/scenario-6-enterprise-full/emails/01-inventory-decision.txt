Subject: DECISION: Inventory Source of Truth for Shopify Migration

Team,

After our technical discovery session and follow-up discussions with our infrastructure team, I want to clarify the final decision on inventory management architecture.

DECISION: Shopify will be the source of truth for inventory levels.

Here's the rationale:

1. REAL-TIME ACCURACY
Shopify's inventory management with webhooks provides true real-time updates across all channels. SAP's inventory module has a minimum 5-minute sync cycle, which causes the overselling issues we currently experience.

2. CHANNEL CONSISTENCY
With Shopify as master, all sales channels (web, mobile app, future marketplaces) pull from one source. This eliminates the sync delays and discrepancies we've been fighting.

3. SIMPLIFIED INTEGRATION
Our WMS (warehouse management system) already has native Shopify integration. Moving inventory master to Shopify means one less integration point to maintain.

4. SCALABILITY
As we expand to more brands and channels, Shopify's inventory system scales better than SAP's rigid structure.

IMPLEMENTATION APPROACH:
- WMS updates Shopify inventory via API (real-time)
- Shopify pushes inventory snapshots to SAP every hour for financial reporting
- SAP remains master for: financial data, purchase orders, vendor management
- Shopify becomes master for: inventory levels, product catalog, pricing

This decision is final and has executive approval from our COO and CFO.

Sarah, I know this is different from our initial conversation, but after analyzing our pain points, this architecture solves more problems. The team agrees this is the right path forward.

Jennifer, please update the technical specifications to reflect Shopify as inventory master. Let me know if you need any clarification.

Thanks,
David
