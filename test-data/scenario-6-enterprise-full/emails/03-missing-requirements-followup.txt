Subject: Missing Requirements - Need Clarification Before Technical Spec

Hi Sarah and David,

As we're finalizing the technical specification, I've identified several areas where we need more information. These gaps could impact project scope and timeline:

1. RETURN & REFUND HANDLING
I don't see documentation on your return/refund process. Key questions:
- What's your return window? (30 days, 60 days, 90 days?)
- Do returns create store credit, refund to original payment method, or both?
- How are partial returns handled?
- Do you charge restocking fees?
- How do returns affect inventory? (return to stock immediately or after inspection?)

This is critical for SAP integration and customer experience.

2. TAX CALCULATION
Your RFP mentions "secure payment processing" but I don't see tax requirements:
- Are you using Shopify's native tax engine or a third-party service (Avalara, TaxJar)?
- Do you have nexus in multiple states?
- Any special tax exemption rules for B2B customers?
- How are tax calculations handled for subscriptions?

Maria mentioned custom tax rules - we need that documentation ASAP.

3. ERROR HANDLING & MONITORING
What happens when integrations fail?
- If Shopify â†’ SAP order sync fails, how should we handle it?
- If inventory sync from WMS fails, what's the fallback?
- What's your acceptable downtime for each integration?
- Who gets notified when something breaks?
- Do you have existing monitoring tools we should integrate with?

4. AUTHENTICATION & SECURITY
- What OAuth flows do you support?
- Any IP whitelisting requirements?
- Data encryption requirements beyond standard HTTPS?
- PCI compliance requirements?
- API rate limiting preferences?

5. EDGE CASES
- How do you handle orders that span multiple warehouses?
- What happens if a customer tries to use a gift card across multiple brands?
- How are backorders managed?
- What if a customer changes their subscription while an order is processing?

6. SUCCESS METRICS
Your RFP mentions "all integrations working properly" as success criteria. Can we define specific KPIs?
- Order sync success rate? (99%? 99.9%?)
- Inventory accuracy threshold? (99.5%?)
- Acceptable data discrepancy rate between systems?
- Page load time targets? (we have these now, thank you!)
- Conversion rate targets?

Without these details, we risk building something that doesn't meet your actual needs. Can we schedule a working session next week to address these gaps?

Best regards,
Jennifer
