Subject: RE: Clarification on Performance Requirements

Hi Jennifer and Alex,

Thanks for the follow-up questions on performance requirements. You're right that terms like "fast" and "real-time" need specific definitions. Here are the concrete requirements from our product team:

INVENTORY SYNC TIMING:
When I said "real-time inventory," here's what we actually need:
- Inventory updates must propagate across all brands within 30 seconds maximum
- Webhook triggers from WMS should fire within 5 seconds of inventory change
- If an order is placed, inventory decrement must happen within 10 seconds
- Customers should never see "Add to Cart" for out-of-stock items (immediate unavailability)

PAGE LOAD PERFORMANCE:
- Homepage: Under 2 seconds for full page load (including all images)
- Product pages: Under 1.5 seconds
- Collection pages: Under 2 seconds
- Cart/Checkout: Under 1 second per step

CHECKOUT SPEED:
When I said checkout should be "quick," here are our targets:
- Add to cart response: Under 500ms
- Proceed to checkout: Under 300ms
- Payment processing: Under 2 seconds
- Order confirmation: Immediate (under 1 second)

Our analytics show that every additional second of checkout time costs us 5% in conversion rate, so these targets are based on real business impact.

API RESPONSE TIMES:
- Product catalog API: Under 200ms for search/filter
- Customer data API: Under 100ms
- Order submission API: Under 500ms

SCALABILITY TARGETS:
You asked what "scalable" means for us. Here are our projections:
- Current: 50,000 orders/month average, 5,000 peak day
- Year 1: 100,000 orders/month, 10,000 peak day
- Year 3: 250,000 orders/month, 25,000 peak day (Black Friday/Cyber Monday)
- Concurrent users during peak: 5,000-10,000

The system needs to handle 3x our current volume without performance degradation.

Does this give you the specificity you need for the technical specs?

Best,
Sarah
