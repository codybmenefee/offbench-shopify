==============================================================================

1. CURRENT STATE ASSESSMENT
---------------------------

Marcus: "Let's start by level-setting. David, can you summarize where we are with inventory management today?"

David: "Sure. We're using Shopify Plus with Stocky for inventory. Three locations: warehouse, downtown, and westside. About 180 SKUs. The system works okay but we have constant issues with inventory accuracy, especially across multiple locations."

Kelly: "I'd say it works 'okay' on good days. On bad days it's a nightmare. We oversold three times last week."

Sarah: "Four times. Don't forget the yoga pants incident on Tuesday."

Jason: "That was my sale. Customer was mad. I had to comp her next order."

Marcus: "Right, so we're here because the current system isn't cutting it as we scale. What's our top 3 pain points? Kelly, you go first."

Kelly:
1. "Manual inventory updates take forever. I spend 10+ hours a week on this."
2. "I never know when to reorder. Stocky suggestions are hit or miss."
3. "We don't have good visibility into what's selling fast vs slow."

Sarah:
1. "Overselling. Makes us look unprofessional."
2. "Can't easily see what inventory Jason has at Westside when I need it."
3. "Inventory counts at my store are always wrong in Shopify."

Jason:
1. "Same as Sarah - overselling is embarrassing."
2. "Transfer orders are clunky. When I send product to Sarah, it's a manual process."
3. "I don't trust the inventory numbers in the system."

David:
1. "Multi-location logic in Shopify is confusing. Even I don't fully understand it."
2. "No good alerting. We find out about problems after they happen."
3. "Integrating Stocky with our workflow is harder than expected."

Marcus: "OK so common themes: accuracy, manual work, and lack of visibility. That's what we need to solve."

==============================================================================

2. PAIN POINTS & PRIORITIES (DEEPER DIVE)
------------------------------------------

Marcus: "Let's dig deeper. Kelly, explain the manual work problem."

Kelly: "Every day I'm updating inventory counts. When we receive shipments, I unpack, count, and enter into Shopify manually. When we do physical counts, same thing. When product moves between locations, I have to create transfer orders and make sure both locations confirm. It's death by a thousand clicks."

Marcus: "Can't that be automated?"

David: "Some of it, yes. Receiving inventory could trigger automatic updates if we had a better scanning system. Transfer orders could be streamlined with better workflow tools. But we'd need an integration layer to tie it together."

Marcus: "That's what Lazer is for. Add 'streamlined receiving process' to the list. Next, overselling. Sarah, why does this keep happening?"

Sarah: "Couple reasons. One, the inventory counts are wrong to begin with. Two, even when they're right, there's a lag between when someone buys in-store and when Shopify updates. So someone can buy the last unit in my store, and before it syncs, someone else buys it online."

Jason: "Yeah, and Shopify doesn't know which location has what in real-time. It says '5 units available' but doesn't tell the customer those are split across three locations."

David: "Technically Shopify does track by location, but the online store displays total availability, not per-location. And the sync delay Sarah mentioned is a real issue. POS updates aren't instant."

Marcus: "So we need faster sync and better location-aware inventory. Got it. What about reordering? Kelly, you said Stocky's suggestions are hit or miss?"

Kelly: "Yeah. Sometimes it tells me to order 50 units of something we barely sell. Other times it says order 5 units of our bestseller that we go through in a week. The logic doesn't make sense."

David: "That's because lead times aren't set correctly. Stocky assumes a default lead time if you don't specify, and that throws off the calculations."

Kelly: "I know, I know. I need to set lead times for all 180 products. But I haven't had time."

Marcus: "Is there a way to automate that or make it easier?"

David: "Not really. It's data entry. Kelly needs to work with our suppliers to get lead times and plug them in."

Kelly: "I've been working on it. I'm about halfway done."

Marcus: "Finish it by end of week. The integration will be useless if Stocky's data is garbage."

Kelly: "Understood."

Marcus: "Alright, anything else on pain points before we move on?"

Jason: "Yeah, seasonality. We order way too much winter gear in October, then sit on it all summer. Can we be smarter about that?"

David: "That's more of a forecasting/planning issue than a system issue. But maybe the integration can flag seasonal products and adjust reorder suggestions."

Marcus: "Add it to the nice-to-have list."

==============================================================================

3. MUST-HAVES VS NICE-TO-HAVES
-------------------------------

Marcus: "Let's categorize. What do we HAVE to get out of Phase 1, and what can wait?"

MUST-HAVES (Phase 1):
✓ Multi-location inventory sync that prevents overselling
✓ Real-time (or near real-time) updates across all locations
✓ Low-stock alerts (email/Slack when inventory drops below threshold)
✓ Better integration with Stocky for reorder recommendations
✓ Streamlined transfer orders between stores

NICE-TO-HAVES (Phase 2 or later):
- Seasonal product intelligence
- Variant bulk ordering (order 50 units mixed sizes)
- Advanced reporting dashboard
- Purchase order approval workflow
- Budget tracking for inventory spending
- Barcode scanning for receiving process

Marcus: "Everyone agree on the must-haves?"

All: [nodding/yes/agreed]

Marcus: "Good. That's what we'll tell Lazer to focus on."

==============================================================================

4. BUDGET DISCUSSION
--------------------

Marcus: "Let's talk money. I got a rough estimate from Lazer, somewhere between $10k and $20k for the build, plus ongoing hosting and maintenance."

Kelly: "That's a lot."

Marcus: "Is it? Kelly, how much time do you spend on manual inventory work per week?"

Kelly: "I don't know... 10 hours?"

Marcus: "At your salary, that's roughly $600 a week, or $2,400 a month. If this integration saves even half your time, it pays for itself in less than a year."

Sarah: "And that doesn't count the cost of overselling. We've comped at least $500 worth of orders in the last month because of inventory screwups."

Jason: "Plus lost sales. If we're out of stock online because our counts are wrong, we're missing revenue."

Marcus: "Exactly. So the ROI is there. I'm comfortable with a $15k budget for Phase 1. If it goes over, we'll discuss. But this is an investment in scaling the business."

David: "What about ongoing costs? Lazer mentioned hosting and maintenance."

Marcus: "What's the estimate?"

David: "They said $300-500 a month total."

Marcus: "That's fine. We spend $99/month on Stocky already. Another $400/month for a solution that actually works is worth it."

Kelly: "Agreed."

==============================================================================

5. TIMELINE & MILESTONES
-------------------------

Marcus: "When do we want this live?"

Kelly: "Yesterday."

Marcus: "Realistically, David?"

David: "Lazer said 6-8 weeks for build and testing. So if we start now, mid-March?"

Marcus: "We need it before Q2. We're launching a bunch of new products in April and I don't want inventory chaos during that."

David: "Then we need to push them. Target go-live: March 1st."

Sarah: "That's aggressive."

David: "It is, but Phase 1 scope is pretty focused. If they can't hit that, we'll know early and adjust."

Marcus: "OK, March 1st is the goal. Milestones?"

David (writing on whiteboard):
- Week 1 (Jan 15-19): Kickoff, requirements gathering
- Week 2 (Jan 22-26): Technical setup, API access
- Week 3-4 (Jan 29-Feb 9): Build inventory sync logic
- Week 5 (Feb 12-16): Build alerts and Stocky integration
- Week 6 (Feb 19-23): Testing and QA
- Week 7 (Feb 26-Mar 1): Final testing, training, go-live

Marcus: "Looks good. Any concerns?"

Kelly: "What if testing reveals major issues?"

David: "Then we have a buffer week. Worst case we push to March 8th."

Marcus: "I can live with that."

==============================================================================

6. ROLES & RESPONSIBILITIES
----------------------------

Marcus: "Who's doing what on our side?"

David: "I'll be primary technical contact. I'll coordinate API access, testing, and deployment."

Kelly: "I'll provide inventory data, set up lead times in Stocky, and test the alerts."

Sarah: "Jason and I can test the in-store POS sync. Make sure our sales update correctly."

Jason: "Yep. We can also test transfer orders."

Marcus: "And I'll be executive sponsor. I'll make decisions if we need to change scope or budget. Weekly check-ins with David to track progress."

David: "I'll send weekly status emails every Friday."

Marcus: "Perfect."

==============================================================================

7. QUESTIONS FOR LAZER
-----------------------

David compiled a list:

TECHNICAL QUESTIONS:
1. How do you handle Shopify API rate limits?
2. What's your experience with Stocky integration specifically?
3. Can you set up a dev/staging environment for testing?
4. What happens if the integration goes down? Failover plan?
5. How do you monitor integration health?

FUNCTIONAL QUESTIONS:
6. Can we set different low-stock thresholds per product or category?
7. How do we handle product variants (sizes, colors)?
8. Can the integration suggest transfer orders between locations?
9. What reporting comes out of the box?
10. Can we customize alerts (email, Slack, SMS)?

PROCESS QUESTIONS:
11. What do you need from us to get started?
12. How much of our team's time is required during build phase?
13. What does QA/testing look like?
14. Do you provide training for our team?
15. What's the post-launch support model?

COST QUESTIONS:
16. Is $15k realistic for Phase 1 scope?
17. What's included in ongoing maintenance?
18. Are there any surprise costs we should know about?

Marcus: "Good list. David, lead the technical discussion tomorrow. Kelly, you cover the functional/inventory stuff. I'll handle budget and timeline."

All: Agreed.

==============================================================================

ACTION ITEMS BEFORE TOMORROW'S CALL
------------------------------------

□ David: Send Lazer the technical requirements doc
□ Kelly: Finish setting lead times in Stocky (at least for top 50 SKUs)
□ Sarah: Document specific overselling incidents (examples for Lazer)
□ Jason: Same as Sarah, document problems
□ Marcus: Review budget approval authority (for PO workflow discussion)

==============================================================================

OTHER NOTES
-----------

- Sarah mentioned possibly opening a third retail location in suburbs (Q3/Q4 2024)
  • Not firm yet, but integration should scale to 4+ locations
  • Marcus: "Let's not over-engineer for that now, but keep it in mind."

- Kelly asked about barcode scanning
  • Current process: manual data entry when receiving inventory
  • Future enhancement: scan barcodes to auto-update Shopify
  • Marcus: "Phase 2. Let's get the basics right first."

- Jason asked about B2B wholesale accounts
  • Marcus is talking to a few gyms about bulk orders
  • Would require separate inventory allocation (B2B vs retail)
  • Marcus: "Way down the road. Not relevant for Phase 1."

- Discussion about whether to include accounting (QuickBooks) integration
  • Kelly: "Would be nice to sync POs to QuickBooks."
  • David: "That's a separate project. Let's not mix it with inventory."
  • Marcus: "Agreed. Focus on inventory first, accounting later."

==============================================================================

MEETING WRAP-UP
---------------

Marcus: "Alright, I think we're aligned. Phase 1 is focused on multi-location inventory accuracy, low-stock alerts, and better Stocky integration. Budget is $15k. Timeline is 7 weeks, go-live March 1st. Everyone clear on their role?"

All: Yes / Clear / Got it

Marcus: "Good. Tomorrow's call is at 2pm. David, Kelly, Sarah, Jason - block your calendars. Let's make a good impression on Lazer and get this project moving."

David: "Will do. Thanks everyone."
