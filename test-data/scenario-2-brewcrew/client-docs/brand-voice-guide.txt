==============================================================================
BRAND OVERVIEW
==============================================================================

WHO WE ARE
----------
BrewCrew Coffee is more than a coffee company - we're a community of coffee lovers who believe great coffee should be accessible, sustainable, and fun.

Founded in 2021 by Emma Sullivan, a former barista with a passion for direct-trade relationships, we source exceptional beans from small farms around the world and roast them fresh in Brooklyn.

OUR MISSION
-----------
To bring world-class coffee to everyday people while supporting farmers and building community.

OUR VALUES
----------
• QUALITY FIRST - We never compromise on bean quality
• SUSTAINABILITY - Direct trade relationships, eco-friendly packaging
• COMMUNITY - Coffee brings people together
• EDUCATION - We teach our customers about coffee, not gatekeep
• FUN - Coffee should be enjoyable, not pretentious

==============================================================================
BRAND VOICE
==============================================================================

CORE PERSONALITY TRAITS
------------------------

1. FRIENDLY & APPROACHABLE
We're the coffee friend you want to grab a cup with, not the snobby barista who judges your order.

DO: Use conversational language, contractions, casual tone
DON'T: Use overly formal language, jargon without explanation, intimidating terminology

Example (Good): "We're obsessed with this new Ethiopian coffee. Seriously, it tastes like blueberry pancakes."
Example (Bad): "Our latest Ethiopian offering features notes of anthocyanin-rich fruit with a complex acidity profile."

2. KNOWLEDGEABLE BUT NOT PRETENTIOUS
We know our stuff about coffee, but we don't make you feel dumb if you don't.

DO: Explain coffee concepts simply, share interesting facts, be helpful
DON'T: Use insider terminology without context, make people feel uninformed, be condescending

Example (Good): "Medium roast means we stop roasting just as the beans hit their sweet spot - full flavor without the burnt taste."
Example (Bad): "Our medium roast achieves first crack completion at precisely 420°F using convective heat transfer."

3. ENTHUSIASTIC & PASSIONATE
We genuinely love coffee and it shows. Our excitement is infectious.

DO: Use exclamation points (sparingly!), show enthusiasm, share stories
DON'T: Overuse caps lock, be overly sales-y, fake excitement

Example (Good): "You're gonna love this. Our roaster Maria literally danced when she tried this batch."
Example (Bad): "BUY NOW!!! BEST COFFEE EVER!!!! LIMITED TIME!!!!"

4. AUTHENTIC & TRANSPARENT
We tell it like it is. No BS, no marketing fluff.

DO: Be honest, admit mistakes, share behind-the-scenes stories
DON'T: Overpromise, hide problems, use empty marketing speak

Example (Good): "We're sold out of the Guatemala right now because literally everyone ordered it. Good news: More roasting Monday."
Example (Bad): "Due to unprecedented demand, this exclusive offering has reached capacity. Please check back for future availability."

==============================================================================

==============================================================================

TONE VARIATIONS BY CHANNEL
---------------------------

EMAIL MARKETING (Most common use)
Tone: Friendly, conversational, helpful
Length: Short paragraphs, easy to scan

We noticed you're a fan of light roasts (great taste, by the way). 

We just got in a new Ethiopian natural process that's basically sunshine in a cup. Bright, fruity, with notes of blueberry and strawberry. It's the kind of coffee that makes mornings actually good.

Want to try it? Here's 15% off your first bag: [code]"

SOCIAL MEDIA
Tone: Playful, engaging, community-focused
Length: Short and punchy
Style: Questions, calls to action, emoji-friendly

Example:
"Coffee quiz: Are you a light roast or dark roast person? ☕
(No wrong answers... but we might judge a little 😉)"

WEBSITE COPY

Length: Varies, but break up with headers and bullets
Style: Mix of first person and second person

EXAMPLES IN ACTION
==============================================================================

REORDER REMINDER EMAIL
Subject: Running low? We've got you covered.

Hey Alex,

It's been about two weeks since your last order of our Colombia Supremo. If you're anything like us, that bag's probably looking pretty empty right about now.

Want to restock? We've got your usual ready to go. Just click below and we'll roast it fresh and ship it out tomorrow.

[Reorder Button]

P.S. If you loved the Colombia, you might dig our new Brazil. Similar smooth vibes, but with a little caramel sweetness. Just saying.

Cheers,
The BrewCrew Team

WIN-BACK EMAIL (CANCELLED SUBSCRIPTION)
Subject: We miss you (and your coffee routine does too)

Hey Jordan,

We noticed you cancelled your subscription a while back. No hard feelings! But we wanted to check in.

Was something off? Did we screw up your roast preference? Did life just get busy?

We'd love to win you back. Here's 20% off if you want to give us another shot.

[Restart Subscription]

Or just reply and tell us what we could do better. Seriously, we want to hear it.

Hope to brew for you again soon,
Emma & the BrewCrew Team
