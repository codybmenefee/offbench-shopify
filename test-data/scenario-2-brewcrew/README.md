# Scenario 2: BrewCrew Coffee - Shopify + Klaviyo Integration

## Business Context
BrewCrew Coffee is a coffee subscription brand focused on customer engagement and retention. They use Shopify for sales and want to leverage Klaviyo for sophisticated marketing automation and customer segmentation.

## Integration Objective
Sync customer and order data from Shopify to Klaviyo to enable personalized marketing campaigns, customer segmentation, and automated reorder reminders.

## Discovery Documents in This Scenario

### Call Transcripts with Brand Documentation
1. **transcripts/01-sales-call.txt** - Initial 30-minute sales call with marketing lead
2. **transcripts/02-discovery-session.txt** - 45-minute scoping call with multiple stakeholders
3. **client-docs/brand-voice-guide.txt** - Brand positioning and messaging document
4. **emails/founder-requirements.txt** - Quick email from founder with must-haves

## Intentional Gaps for Testing
- Data privacy/compliance vaguely mentioned
- Segmentation criteria not clearly defined
- Reorder reminder timing not specified
- Guest checkout handling not discussed
- No mention of email cadence limits or unsubscribe handling
- Historical data migration not addressed

## Expected Tool Outputs
- Gap detection: Missing GDPR/privacy requirements, undefined segmentation logic, unclear email timing
- Ambiguity surfacing: What defines a "reorder window"? Which customer data should sync?
- Confidence score: Should be moderate (60-70%) due to marketing complexity
- Generated questions: 5-6 questions about segmentation rules, data privacy, email triggers
