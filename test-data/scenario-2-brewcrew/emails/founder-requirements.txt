Subject: Must-haves for Klaviyo integration (before I forget!)

Hey Rachel (and Marcus),

I'm jumping on a red-eye tomorrow morning and wanted to brain-dump some must-haves for the Klaviyo project before I forget. Feel free to forward to the Lazer team.

MUST-HAVES (like seriously can't launch without these):

1. **SUBSCRIPTION DATA EVERYWHERE**
   - I need to see subscription status in every single customer profile in Klaviyo
   - Active vs cancelled vs paused - this is THE most important segment
   - If someone cancels, we need to know immediately so we can trigger win-back campaigns

2. **PRODUCT PREFERENCE TRACKING**
   - Every customer should be tagged with their roast preference (light/medium/dark)
   - Also track origin preference if possible (Ethiopian lovers, Colombia fans, etc.)
   - This is how we personalize. Can't send dark roast promos to someone who only buys light.

3. **REVENUE TRACKING THAT ACTUALLY WORKS**
   - I need to see $ attributed to each email campaign
   - ROI tracking is critical. If I'm spending money on email marketing, I need to prove it's working
   - Historical data would be great too but at minimum, track going forward

4. **REORDER REMINDERS (duh)**
   - This is literally the whole point of Phase 1
   - Timing needs to be smart - base it on product size
   - If someone ignores the first reminder, follow up with a discount
   - Don't be annoying though. Max 2 reminders then leave them alone.

5. **WIN-BACK FLOW FOR CANCELLED SUBS**
   - When someone cancels, wait like a week, then start a win-back sequence
   - Maybe 3-4 emails over a month? First one is empathetic, last one is "here's 25% off to come back"
   - This is where we're losing the most revenue. Retention is our biggest problem.

NICE-TO-HAVES (but let's talk budget):

- Birthday emails (do we even collect birthdays? we should)
- Referral program tracking (if they refer a friend, tag them as advocates)
- Product review requests after delivery
- VIP tier recognition (customers over $500 lifetime spend)

THINGS I'M WORRIED ABOUT:

- **Spam filters** - If we start sending more emails, will we end up in spam? Do we need to warm up our sending?
- **Unsubscribes** - What if our unsubscribe rate goes up because we're emailing more? How do we monitor that?
- **Data privacy** - Are we allowed to email everyone in our database? What about people who didn't explicitly opt in?
- **Email fatigue** - How do we make sure we're not over-emailing people? Like if someone's in multiple flows, do they get 3 emails in one day?

RANDOM THOUGHTS:

- Can we A/B test subject lines in Klaviyo? That would be sick.
- What about SMS? Is that part of this or separate?
- Does Klaviyo have a mobile app? I want to check campaign performance on my phone.
- Can we see which products are driving the most repeat orders? That would help us plan inventory.

TIMELINE PRESSURE:

Rachel already told you, but I'll say it again - we need this ASAP. Our churn rate is killing us. Every week we delay is lost revenue. I know good work takes time but please don't let this drag into March.

Also, Kevin mentioned something about testing? Yes please. I don't want to accidentally email our entire customer base with a broken link or wrong discount code. Whatever QA process you recommend, I'm on board.

OK that's it. Sorry for the wall of text. Let me know if you have questions. I'll be back from my trip on Saturday.

Thanks!
Emma

P.S. - Rachel, did you send Lazer our brand voice guide? They should probably read that before building any email templates.

P.P.S. - Marcus, do you folks do email design too or is that on us? Our emails right now are pretty basic. Would be cool to make them more on-brand but not sure if that's in scope.
